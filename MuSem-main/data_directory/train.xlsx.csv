MORE allegations against 'Buttman ' Affleck ...,"Ben Affleck has become the subject of shame and mockery after more allegations of groping emerged this week . <EOS> Affleck , who is about to appear as Batman for the second time in DC 's big-budget superhero film Justice League , has been called `` Buttman '' on social media since make-up artist Annamarie Tendler became the second woman to allege that he touched her . <EOS> <EOP> Days after condemning the actions of his former colleague Harvey Weinstein , who has been accused of three incidents of rape and countless accounts of sexual assault of young female stars , Affleck publicly apologised for touching actress Hilarie Burton live on camera in 2003 . <EOS> <EOP> The apology came after Burton admitted that she had not forgotten the incident : <EOS> ",0
Kexit ? Iraqi Kurdistan referendum explained,"Voters in parts of northern Iraq are due to head to the polls on Monday for an independence referendum . <EOS> <EOP> The only fly in the guacamole is our legislature . <EOS> Funding for the wall ( and it is a truly great wall , believe me ) has to be put into the yearly budget . <EOS> That budget has to be written and approved by the legislature . <EOS> But leadership in both the house and senate seem unwilling to budge in their opposition to adding an additional 70 billion dollars to that budget . <EOS> That ’ s 1.228 trillion pesos amigos . <EOS> That ’ s a passel of pesos . <EOS> <EOP> Home to six million Kurds , the Kurdistan region already has its own government . <EOS> <EOP> But now , after a long history of brutal repression , it wants to become an independent state . <EOS> <EOP> Iraq 's PM , the country 's neighbours and Western powers want the vote cancelled or postponed . <EOS> <EOP> BBC Arabic ’ s Radwa Gamal asked people in the regional capital , Irbil , why they want a Yes result . <EOS> <EOP> This is what it all comes down to . <EOS> The House and Senate will approve a budget and pass it on to the President . <EOS> He , in turn , either accepts the bill or sends it back to congress for further tweaking . <EOS> He also has the option of a flat out veto . <EOS> That means congress starts again from scratch . <EOS> In both the , send it back and veto scenarios , the bill goes unsigned and large portions of the government go unfunded and consequently shut down . <EOS> ",1
"Reminder : Whether or not Trump asked Rod Rosenstein for a recommendation , he did n't get one","Did President Trump ask Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to produce a recommendation that he fire former FBI Director James Comey ? <EOS> <EOP> When asked point blank by NBC 's Lester Holt on Thursday , Trump would n't say . <EOS> <EOP> But as speculation over whether the president worked with Rosenstein to materialize a justification for Comey 's firing ensues , it 's important to remember one key detail — whether or not Trump asked Rosenstein for a recommendation , he did n't get one . <EOS> <EOP> My colleague Phil Wegmann pointed out yesterday that Rosenstein 's memo never explicitly says Trump should fire Comey . <EOS> <EOP> Sure enough , Rosenstein 's letter laid out all the ways the FBI director had acted inappropriately , and at times implied that firing Comey would be best . <EOS> But here 's a point that seems to be getting lost : Rosenstein never explicitly recommended firing Comey . <EOS> <EOP> The three-page , thousand-word letter has widely been interpreted as a death sentence . <EOS> But after thoroughly trashing Comey 's handling of the Clinton email controversy , Rosenstein ends his overwhelming legal performance without a climax . <EOS> <EOP> Nevertheless , White House officials , including the president himself , have since referred to the memo repeatedly as a `` recommendation . '' <EOS> <EOP> The Wall Street Journal included a roundup of the most notable mentions in an article on Thursday afternoon : <EOS> <EOP> Asked Tuesday why Mr. Trump was firing Mr. Comey four months into his term , senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said : `` Well , I would point them to the three letters that were received today . '' <EOS> <EOP> Sarah Sanders , a White House spokeswoman , told Fox News on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had reacted after receiving a `` clear and direct and very strong recommendation from the deputy attorney general . '' <EOS> <EOP> Ms. Sanders , on MSNBC the following morning , said the reason for the dismissal was `` real simple ... <EOS> The deputy attorney general made a very strong recommendation . '' <EOS> <EOP> Wednesday morning , Vice President Mike Pence , speaking to reporters at the Capitol , repeatedly pointed to Mr. Rosenstein 's letter while describing the president 's decision . <EOS> <EOP> Whether or not it matters that Trump asked Rosenstein for a recommendation is a different debate , but it 's well worth remembering that he never got one . <EOS> <EOP> According to WSJ 's report , Rosenstein asked the White House to `` correct '' its `` depiction '' that Trump 's decision was made in direct response to the memo , something that was heavily implied in Trump 's original letter to Comey notifying him of his termination . <EOS> <EOP> The question now is why the White House is referring to Rosenstein 's memo as a recommendation when he seems to have deliberately stopped short of making it one . <EOS> ",0
Corporate America finally got on board to fight climate change . Then came Trump .,"President Trump has long talked about how he wants to run the federal government like a business . <EOS> Many of his Cabinet members came from the corporate world . <EOS> On matters ranging from health care to taxes , he routinely solicits the advice of his business associates . <EOS> <EOP> But when it comes to climate change , Trump has actively ignored corporate leaders ’ calls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . <EOS> On Thursday afternoon , he announced his decision to pull out of the Paris climate deal — fulfilling a promise he made on the campaign trail , but breaking with some of the CEOs who have advised him . <EOS> At least one of those CEOs , Elon Musk , said he would quit Trump ’ s advisory council as a result . <EOS> <EOP> Many of America ’ s largest businesses and corporations have been vocal in their support for government policies meant to curb carbon emissions . <EOS> More than 60 Fortune 500 companies signed a letter to the administration urging Trump to “ re-affirm our deep commitment to addressing climate change ” by staying in the Paris agreement . <EOS> Industries that were once resistant to carbon emissions rules — such as the energy sector — have been investing more in renewable energy and natural gas production in recent years . <EOS> And big corporations that consume tons of electricity say renewable energy sources are more affordable than ever . <EOS> <EOP> But a smaller number of businesses — mostly US manufacturers and coal companies — have fiercely resisted the Paris deal , and their message apparently resonated more with Trump . <EOS> They said that forcing businesses to curb their use of fossil fuels will cost too much money and lead to layoffs . <EOS> <EOP> In the White House Rose Garden on Thursday , Trump echoed their language to describe the climate deal , saying it would lead to “ lost jobs , lower wages , shuttered factories , and vastly diminished economic production . ” <EOS> <EOP> Virginia Democrat Dan Helmer released arguably the WORST POLITICAL AD ever . <EOS> <EOP> Twenty years ago , US corporations were resistant to any suggestions to cut back on their consumption of fossil fuels . <EOS> Renewable energy sources were expensive and harder to find . <EOS> And scientific evidence that humans were making the planet warmer wasn ’ t as strong . <EOS> <EOP> That started to change in 2007 , when the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a groundbreaking report , authored by thousands of international scientists , showing overwhelming evidence that carbon emissions from human activity were increasing global temperatures . <EOS> <EOP> “ It ratcheted up the certainty of this being the issue , and we saw it as a real risk for our business , ” said Kevin Rabinovitch , global sustainability director for Mars Inc. , which owns brands like M & Ms , Skittles , and Pedigree pet food . <EOS> <EOP> Corporations that rely heavily on agriculture — including Mars — also started to see the direct effects of increasing droughts and unpredictable weather patterns . <EOS> Ruined cocoa and wheat crops caused prices to spike , and that affected the bottom line , says Rabinovitch . <EOS> Corporations began creating sustainability offices , like the one he runs , to find ways to reduce their carbon footprint . <EOS> They began investing more in wind power and other renewable energy sources . <EOS> Now it ’ s rare to find a Fortune 500 company that doesn ’ t have staff dedicated to sustainability issues . <EOS> <EOP> That change also reflects consumer preferences . <EOS> A majority of Americans now believe humans are responsible for global warming , and think the federal government should regulate greenhouse gas emissions . <EOS> Sustainability suddenly mattered to a lot more to people , so corporations had to address that as a way to attract the most talented workers . <EOS> <EOP> Tech companies such as Apple and Google have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint in recent years , and retailers like Walmart and Staples joined them in signing the letter urging Trump not to back out of the deal . <EOS> <EOP> In the end , they lost out to coal . <EOS> <EOP> Economists say pulling out of the Paris accord will do nothing to bring back manufacturing and coal jobs , but Trump couched his decision in the language of job creation . <EOS> He followed the lead of two of the largest manufacturing trade groups , the National Association of Manufacturers and the Industrial Energy Consumers of America , which said the goals of the Paris deal were too harsh and would cost too much for manufacturers . <EOS> <EOP> The IECA sent its own strongly worded letter to the administration in recent weeks . <EOS> The group warned that if energy costs rise — whether because of global markets or emissions regulations — manufacturers would move more jobs overseas . <EOS> <EOP> The liberal candidate sings about the Planned Parenthood abortion business and the Obamacare disaster . <EOS> <EOP> What a bizarre ad . <EOS> <EOP> “ To avoid the perverse and economically damaging consequences ... we must ensure that any climate policy does not tilt the playing field toward our global competitors and place the US at a competitive disadvantage , ” Paul Cicio , the IECA president , wrote Trump last month . <EOS> <EOP> Both groups declined to talk to Vox , and instead released statements praising Trump ’ s decision . <EOS> <EOP> “ As the President has acknowledged , certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers , ” wrote Ross Eisenberg , vice president of energy and resources policy for NAM . <EOS> “ We look forward to working with the President as he negotiates a better deal to address this international policy challenge . ” <EOS> <EOP> Then he promised that manufacturers would reduce greenhouse gas emissions on their own . <EOS> ",1
Gov ’ t Watchdog Ends Probe Of Zinke ’ s Threats To Senators Over O ’ Care Repeal Vote,"Unable to get either Alaska senator to spill the beans about allegations that a member of President Trump ’ s cabinet threatened funding to their state in order to secure their votes on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act , a government watchdog is closing his investigation into the matter . <EOS> <EOP> As the White House scrambled unsuccessfully in July to whip the votes for the health care repeal bill , Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke allegedly called both of Alaska ’ s Republican senators—Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan—and communicated a “ troubling message ” about future federal dollars for their state if they didn ’ t fall in line . <EOS> <EOP> The ham-handed gambit backfired spectacularly . <EOS> Murkowski , who chairs the committee that controls the Interior Department ’ s budget and confirmation process , defiantly voted against the Obamacare repeal bill , noting that she is “ strong and independent ” and would not bow to intimidation . <EOS> <EOP> Though Murkowski and Zinke later made a show of making amends over a beer , other members of Congress found the episode disturbing , and demanded a federal inquiry . <EOS> <EOP> In a letter on Wednesday to the two House Democrats who demanded the probe , however , the Interior Department ’ s inspector general said that “ further investigation would be unproductive . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ Both Senators Murkowski and Sullivan declined to be interviewed or to provide statements regarding the matter , ” Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall wrote . <EOS> “ The OIG does not believe that it could meaningfully investigate the matter further . ” <EOS> ",0
SoCal beach cities beset by mysterious nauseating odor ...,"A recurring foul odor that some residents say causes headaches and nausea is a serious issue and needs more focus , says a Huntington Beach city councilman who wants a special committee to be formed on the issue . <EOS> <EOP> Here is how the Supreme Court ’ s ruling is being reported by the Washington Times <EOS> <EOP> “ Not enough progress is being made to address the source of the odor , ” Councilman Billy O ’ Connell said in a statement proposing the item . <EOS> <EOP> The city said in a post last week on its website that the odor wasn ’ t believed to be “ an immediate life safety issue . ” <EOS> <EOP> The South Coast Air Quality Management District is leading an investigation . <EOS> <EOP> The agency ’ s website says that multiple sources in the area are capable of producing disagreeable odors and the periodic nature and varying location of complaints makes assessing the cause difficult . <EOS> SCAQMD spokesman Sam Atwood said last week that the analysis of complaints and wind directions points to an offshore source . <EOS> <EOP> The Huntington Beach Fire Department has also been working with the agency . <EOS> <EOP> Several residents showed up to a council meeting on Sept. 18 to request help from the city with the odor and complained of headaches , nausea and sore throats . <EOS> <EOP> Harrowing stories emerge after two massive rockfalls at Yosemite National Park <EOS> <EOP> Suspect in 1980 slaying of pregnant newlywed identified , police say <EOS> ",1

Astronaut Peggy Whitson breaks new space record,"Peggy Whitson has broken the record for most days in space by a US astronaut . <EOS> <EOP> Dr Whitson already holds records for the most spacewalks carried out by a woman astronaut and is the first woman to command the International Space Station ( ISS ) twice . <EOS> <EOP> Now she 's beaten the record previously set by Jeff Williams , who had a total of 534 days in space . <EOS> <EOP> President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka have called Dr Whitson to congratulate her . <EOS> <EOP> The number of mature individuals is estimated to be 2,710-3,386 , but the assessment says that number may be considerably higher . <EOS> Still , the IUCN thinks the population is declining overall , even while it may be `` modestly increasing '' in some areas . <EOS> <EOP> A beetle called the emerald ash borer is wrecking havoc on North America 's ash trees . <EOS> Five out of the six most prominent species are listed as critically endangered , and the sixth is now listed as endangered . <EOS> <EOP> The beetle `` arrived in Michigan from Asia in the late 1990s via infested shipping pallets , '' the IUCN says , and is believed to be responsible for the destruction of millions of trees . <EOS> <EOP> The relentless destruction is likely to impact some 80 percent of the trees , which could `` dramatically change the composition of both wild and urban forests , '' Murphy Westwood , member of the IUCN Global Tree Specialist Group , said in a statement . <EOS> She adds that scientists are racing to try to find a way to stop the attack on trees . <EOS> <EOP> However , they 're up against serious obstacles — the IUCN says that rising temperatures are actually helping the beetle expand to new areas . <EOS> <EOP> The IUCN assessment also found that five antelope species from Africa are `` declining drastically as a result of poaching , habitat degradation and competition with domestic livestock . '' <EOS> That includes the giant eland , the largest antelope in the world . <EOS> <EOP> Inger Andersen , the director general of the IUCN , says species generally are declining at a rate that is difficult for scientists to keep up with . <EOS> `` Even those species that we thought were abundant and safe — such as antelopes in Africa or ash trees in the U.S. — now face an imminent threat of extinction . '' <EOS> <EOP> During their video chat between the White House and the International Space Station , President Trump started by telling Peggy Whitson that her achievement was a `` glorious day in the history of space flight '' . <EOS> <EOP> `` Today Commander Whitson , you have broken the record for the most total time spent in space by an American astronaut - 534 days and counting , '' he said . <EOS> <EOP> `` That 's an incredible record to break and on behalf of our nation , and frankly on behalf of the world , I 'd like to congratulate you . <EOS> That is really something . '' <EOS> <EOP> Donald Trump then asked Dr Whitson what she thought of her achievement . <EOS> <EOP> She replied : `` It 's actually a huge honour to break a record like this but it 's an honour for me to be representing all the folks at Nasa who make the space flight possible , who make me setting this record feasible . <EOS> <EOP> `` It 's a very exciting time to be at Nasa . <EOS> We 're excited about the missions to Mars in the 2030s . <EOS> We actually have hardware on the ground being built for the SLS rocket for the test flights , which will eventually take us there . <EOS> <EOP> `` I 'm so proud of the team . '' <EOS> <EOP> Replying to a question from President Trump on what they 're learning from being in orbit around Earth , Dr Whitson said they were studying the effects of deep space travel on the human body for the planned Mars missions and said water was a particular challenge . <EOS> <EOP> `` Right now we 're taking solar power , which we collect and are using it to break apart water into oxygen and hydrogen . <EOS> The oxygen we breath . <EOS> We use the hydrogen , combine it back with the CO2 that we take out of the air and make more water . <EOS> <EOP> `` But water is such a precious resource up here that we are also cleaning up our urine and making it drinkable - and it 's really not as bad as it sounds . '' <EOS> <EOP> Mr Trump replied : `` That 's good . <EOS> I 'm glad to hear that . <EOS> Better you than me . '' <EOS> <EOP> Earlier this month , Nasa astronaut Shane Kimbrough turned command of the ISS over to Dr Whitson . <EOS> <EOP> `` She will set another record at this moment , '' he said at the time . <EOS> <EOP> `` She now becomes the first two-time female commander of the International Space Station . <EOS> <EOP> `` The Space Station is in great hands with Peggy . '' <EOS> <EOP> At 57 , she is also the oldest woman to have gone to space . <EOS> <EOP> Dr Whitson already holds the record for longest time spent in space by a woman . <EOS> <EOP> Born in Iowa , she has an advanced degree in biochemistry and worked for Nasa in several prominent medical science and research positions , before being selected as an astronaut candidate in 1996 . <EOS> <EOP> She first went into space in 2002 and became the first woman to command the ISS in 2007 . <EOS> <EOP> The oldest person to go into space is John Glenn , who was also the first American to orbit Earth in 1962 . <EOS> He went back into space in 1998 aged 77 . <EOS> <EOP> He died last year at the age of 95 . <EOS> <EOP> Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat , search for bbc_newsbeat <EOS> ",1
"Hunters , Fishermen Out in Force to Rescue Houston Flood Victims","Men to whom many often give little thought–men who are first in the duck blind on opening day or last off the lake during a late night of fishing–are now trolling their boats down flooded streets and byways , seeking out Houston residents who may remain trapped and/or in danger . <EOS> <EOP> At a time like this , the value of such men can not be exaggerated ; especially as they find the cold and wet , then lift them into their boats and deliver them to safety . <EOS> <EOP> USA Today reports that many such duck hunters and fishermen–and others possessing private boats–have come together under the auspices of the “ Cajun Navy ” to conduct rescues throughout the flooded Houston area . <EOS> This means “ guys with hunting boats , shallow draft duck hunting boats with mud motors , airboats , pirogues , [ and ] kayaks ” are all involved . <EOS> <EOP> The country is suddenly grateful for this “ Cajun Navy , ” for their know-how , for the fact that they can read a submerged log in the water , and haul their boats over tree stumps and levees and launch them from freeway junctions . <EOS> There are no regulators to check their fishing licenses or whether they have a fire extinguisher and life preservers on board , which they don ’ t . <EOS> They ’ re used to maneuvering through the cypress of Caddo Lake or the hydrilla and coontail of the Atchafalaya , where the water might be four feet or it might rise to 18 , and the stinking bog is called “ coffee grinds ” because of the way boots sink in it . <EOS> Spending hours in monsoon rains doesn ’ t bother them , because they know ducks don ’ t just show up on a plate , and they ’ ve learned what most of us haven ’ t , that dry comfort is not the only thing worth seeking . <EOS> <EOP> The Post also notes that the number of hunters and fishermen-turned-rescuers is so great that they outnumber the number of government rescuers in the Houston area . <EOS> And that point is not a negative reflection on government rescuers ; rather , it is a positive reflection on the burgeoning generosity and spirit of the American heart ; particularly the heart of the American hunter and fisherman . <EOS> <EOP> AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins , a Breitbart News podcast . <EOS> He is also the political analyst for Armed American Radio . <EOS> Follow him on Twitter : @ AWRHawkins . <EOS> Reach him directly at awrhawkins @ breitbart.com . <EOS> ",0

Brexit : May offers more assurances to EU nationals,"Theresa May has vowed to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to remain in the UK after Brexit ahead of a key summit of European leaders . <EOS> <EOP> In a Facebook post , the prime minister insisted the application process for settled status would be `` streamlined '' and the cost `` as low as possible '' . <EOS> <EOP> She said representatives of EU citizens will sit on a `` user group '' which will iron out any problems in the system . <EOS> <EOP> The other 27 EU leaders will assess overall progress in the talks so far . <EOS> <EOP> At a meeting on Friday , at which the UK will not be present , they are expected to conclude officially that `` insufficient progress '' has been made on the status of EU nationals in the UK and British expats on the continent - and other separation issues - to move onto the second phase of trade discussions . <EOS> <EOP> European Council President Donald Tusk said there would be no `` breakthrough '' at the two-day summit , but progress could be achieved by the next scheduled meeting of EU leaders in December . <EOS> <EOP> Before leaving for Brussels , Mrs May used her Facebook post to offer further assurances to the three million or so nationals of other EU countries living in the UK and uncertain about their future after Brexit . <EOS> <EOP> President Donald Trump said he wants to shut off internet access for suspected terrorist organizations in a series of tweets Friday morning , just hours after an explosion rocked London ’ s underground transportation system . <EOS> <EOP> In her message , she said those who already had permanent residence would be able to `` swap this '' for settled status in as hassle-free a way as possible . <EOS> <EOP> The October summit was always the first date in the EU calendar on which a gathering of the 27 heads of government could declare themselves satisfied with the Brexit divorce negotiations and agree to start talking about trade . <EOS> <EOP> It 's been clear for weeks that they wo n't do that - but they will offer the UK some encouragement by starting internal discussions about future trade with the UK - ready for any breakthrough at the next summit in December . <EOS> <EOP> Theresa May is n't expected to make any big new proposal in her after-dinner remarks but to underline the quality of the financial offer made in her speech in Florence - worth around £20bn . <EOS> <EOP> The EU side wants more though - more money as well as further movement on citizens rights and the Irish border . <EOS> <EOP> There are almost as many predictions about what happens next as there are diplomats in Brussels ; one has suggested that the prospects of a December breakthrough are no better than fifty-fifty but an official close to the talks said the signal on Brexit from this summit would be fundamentally positive . <EOS> <EOP> `` I know there is real anxiety about how the agreement will be implemented , '' she wrote . <EOS> <EOP> `` People are concerned that the process will be complicated and bureaucratic , and will put up hurdles that are difficult to overcome . <EOS> I want to provide reassurance here too . <EOS> <EOP> `` We are developing a streamlined digital process for those applying for settled status in the UK in the future . <EOS> This process will be designed with users in mind , and we will engage with them every step of the way .

'' <EOS> <EOP> Mrs May , who will address other leaders at a working dinner on Thursday , wants mutual dialogue on the UK 's future relationship with the EU , including trade and defence , to begin as soon as possible . <EOS> <EOP> But Mr Tusk is expected to propose to the 27 EU leaders that they begin talks amongst themselves about Britain 's future relationship with the EU , when it leaves the bloc in March 2019 . <EOS> <EOP> As well as citizens ' rights , the two sides remain at odds over the so-called financial `` divorce '' settlement and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic . <EOS> <EOP> A group of pro-Brexit Tory and Labour politicians - including former Chancellor Lord Lawson , former Conservative minister Owen Paterson and Labour MP Kate Hoey - is urging Mrs May to walk away from negotiations this week if the EU does not accommodate the UK 's wishes . <EOS> <EOP> A letter to the PM , organised by the Leave Means Leave campaign and also signed by pro-Brexit business figures , says the government `` has been more than patient '' and `` decisive action '' is now needed to end the `` highly damaging '' levels of uncertainty facing businesses . <EOS> <EOP> In the event of no progress at Thursday 's meeting , the letter says , Mrs May should formally declare the UK is working on the assumption it will be reverting to World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) rules on 30 March 2019 . <EOS> <EOP> Early notification of such a move would allow the UK to `` concentrate our resources on resolving administrative issues '' and prepare to `` crystallise the economic opportunities '' of Brexit , it adds . <EOS> <EOP> “ Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner , ” the president wrote early Friday . <EOS> “ The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off and use better ! ” <EOS> <EOP> Meanwhile , a trade body for the UK 's creative sector has warned that money generated by it could be hit by a post-Brexit restriction on immigration . <EOS> <EOP> The Creative Industries Federation ( CIF ) said the £87bn a year that UK-made films , music , adverts and video games generated for the UK economy was at risk if immigration was restricted . <EOS> <EOP> The sector relies heavily on freelance staff , many of whom are from the EU , and the CIF wants the government to negotiate free movement of UK and EU workers for short-term projects . <EOS> ",1

Newt Gingrich ’ s New Tell-All Book Reveals Trump ’ s Grossest Habits While On Campaign,"The eating habits of President Trump have been scrutinized by the press many times during his campaign and presidency . <EOS> Once again , the President ’ s diet will be under the microscope of the media because of former Speaker New Gingrich providing an advanced copy of his new tell-all book , “ Understanding Trump , ” to the Washington Examiner . <EOS> <EOP> “ Anytime a meal was served when I flew with candidate Trump aboard his nicely outfitted 757 , it was invariably McDonald ’ s , Wendy ’ s , or a similar fast food , ” wrote Mr. Gingrich in his new book . <EOS> Gingrich doesn ’ t hold his tongue in his new tell-all that accounts the time he spent as a Trump advisor during his campaign and as acting President . <EOS> <EOP> Ironically , Gingrich is not the first House Speaker to comment on Trump ’ s nasty health habits . <EOS> “ I think his family should be concerned about his health , ” Rep. Nancy Pelosi said on MSNBC Thursday . <EOS> “ I ’ m concerned about his fitness for office . ” <EOS> <EOP> Time reported that his staff are forced to cater to his big ego AND bad diet choices <EOS> <EOP> “ As he settles down , they bring him a Diet Coke , while the rest of us are served water , with the Vice President sitting at one end of the table . <EOS> With the salad course , Trump is served what appears to be Thousand Island dressing instead of the creamy vinaigrette for his guests . <EOS> When the chicken arrives , he is the only one given an extra dish of sauce . <EOS> At the dessert course , he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie , instead of the single scoop for everyone else . ” <EOS> <EOP> On top of his food choices , he ’ s also been criticized for the bizarre way he eats . <EOS> Pizza with a knife and fork ? <EOS> Weird . <EOS> <EOP> Apparently , once you start chowing down on fast food with a knife and fork , you don ’ t go back . <EOS> Or maybe the cutlery just makes him feel better about his KFC habit ? <EOS> <EOP> It will be interesting to see what comes out of Gingrich ’ s book about the lifestyle of our President . <EOS> Base on his current track record of bizarre habits , it should be pretty entertaining and probably gross . <EOS> <EOP> Marijuana legalization activists fear Sessions may be willing to ignore evidence and resume strict enforcement of federal prohibition . <EOS> The Obama administration guidance that allows state-legal marijuana could be reversed or altered by Sessions in ways that could doom thriving industries many states now consider legal . <EOS> ",1
Last U.S. county at risk for being uncovered lands insurer for health exchange,"COLUMBUS , Ohio — The lone county currently at risk of going uncovered on the federal health law 's insurance exchanges has landed an insurer . <EOS> <EOP> CareSource will step up to provide health insurance coverage in Paulding County , Ohio , in 2018 , The Associated Press has learned . <EOS> The company and state Department of Insurance planned to announce the arrangement Thursday . <EOS> <EOP> The most recent national analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation identified Paulding , in northwest Ohio just south of Toledo , as the final county still at risk of lacking a provider when 2018 signups begin Nov. 1 . <EOS> About 10 million people , including 11,000 Ohio residents , currently are served through HealthCare.gov and its state counterparts , a system created under the federal Affordable Care Act . <EOS> <EOP> Earlier this year , well over 40 mostly rural counties faced the prospect of having no options for their exchanges . <EOS> Insurers who withdrew cited steep losses and uncertainly over the future of President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act . <EOS> <EOP> Insurers have been pulling back from the exchanges after getting stung by heavy losses and struggling to attract enough young , healthy customers to balance all the claims they get from people who use their coverage . <EOS> <EOP> In Ohio alone , 20 of 88 counties lost insurers . <EOS> State officials had previously announced coverage in the 19 others . <EOS> <EOP> Rural counties , in particular , have been particularly uninviting for them because they usually have a smaller , older customer base and a care provider like a hospital system with a dominant market position . <EOS> That can make it difficult to negotiate payment rates . <EOS> <EOP> While insurers have made preliminary plans to sell coverage on the exchanges next year , they still have about a month to back out . <EOS> <EOP> Insurers are worried , in particular , about the fate of billions of dollars in payments from the government to cover cost-sharing reductions for customers with modest incomes . <EOS> These payments reimburse insurers for lowering deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses for customers . <EOS> They are separate from the income-based tax credits that help people buy coverage . <EOS> <EOP> The federal government announced last week that it will make these payments for this month , but their future is unclear . <EOS> President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to end them , and insurers say premiums will soar for some of their plans if this happens . <EOS> <EOP> But CareSource President and CEO Pamela Morris expressed her company 's commitment to the exchange , also called the Marketplace . <EOS> It had been one of the insurers to cover some other counties that lost their exchange options . <EOS> <EOP> `` The Marketplace provides vital health care coverage to more than 10.3 million Americans and we want to be a resource for consumers left without options , '' she said in a statement . <EOS> `` Our decision to offer coverage in the bare counties speaks to our mission and commitment to the Marketplace and serving those who are in need of health care coverage . '' <EOS> <EOP> Ohio State Insurance Director Jillian Froment said working through the challenge of covering affected counties has been a priority of her staff in recent weeks . <EOS> <EOP> `` There is a lot of uncertainty facing consumers when it comes to health insurance and these announcements will provide important relief , '' she said . <EOS> <EOP> The department plans to work with insurers in the coming weeks to finalize the products and rates that will be available on the exchange in 2018 . <EOS> A review is expected to be completed by early September , and insurers must sign contracts with the federal government by late September to sell coverage on the federal exchange . <EOS> ",0
49ers player on Pence : 'Looks like a PR stunt ',"Nakajima died Monday of pneumonia , his daughter and the Japanese movie studio Toho confirmed to multiple news outlets . <EOS> Nakajima played Godzilla in the 1954 original and 11 subsequent films , donning the suit that he said weighed about 220 pounds and wreaking havoc on model cities and rival monsters . <EOS> <EOP> But he began his career in samurai films , including a small role in Akira Kurosawa 's legendary 1954 film Seven Samurai . <EOS> `` I had the samurai top-knot hairstyle , holding a sword , and I often played the guy who gets killed , '' Nakajima said in an interview earlier this year with the Great Big Story . <EOS> <EOP> Nakajima recounted that he got the attention of Godzilla director Ishiro Honda on the set of a WWII film . <EOS> `` There was a scene where an airplane was on fire and an actor had to jump out of it . <EOS> That was my role , '' he said . <EOS> `` Mr. Honda saw this scene and thought , 'This guy is full of energy .

"FALL PREVIEW : ESPN Football Analyst Walks Away , Disturbed by Brain Trauma on Field ...","“ In its current state , there are some real dangers : broken limbs , wear and tear , ” Cunningham said . <EOS> “ But the real crux of this is that I just don ’ t think the game is safe for the brain . <EOS> To me , it ’ s unacceptable . ” <EOS> <EOP> Football has dominated Cunningham ’ s life , he said , since he began playing as a freshman in high school . <EOS> He was captain of the University of Washington ’ s 1991 national championship team and a third-round draft choice in the N.F.L. , where he was an offensive lineman for five seasons . <EOS> He has been a broadcaster since , paired for most of the last decade with the play-by-play announcer Mike Patrick for Saturday afternoon games televised on ABC and ESPN . <EOS> <EOP> As a color analyst , primarily providing commentary between plays , Cunningham built a reputation among college football fans , and even coaches , for his pointed criticism toward what he thought were reckless hits and irresponsible coaching decisions that endangered the health of athletes . <EOS> His strong opinions often got him denounced on fan message boards and earned him angry calls from coaches and administrators . <EOS> <EOP> “ I could hardly disagree with anything he said , ” Patrick , who will have a new broadcast partner this season in Cunningham ’ s absence , said in a phone interview . <EOS> “ The sport is at a crossroads . <EOS> I love football — college football , pro football , any kind of football . <EOS> It ’ s a wonderful sport . <EOS> But now that I realize what it can do to people , that it can turn 40- , 50-year-old men into walking vegetables , how do you stay silent ? <EOS> Ed was in the vanguard of this . <EOS> I give him all the credit in the world . <EOS> And I ’ m going to be outspoken on it , in part because he led me to that drinking hole . ” <EOS> <EOP> Still a sturdy 6-foot-3 and 240 pounds , Cunningham explained his position while sitting in a booth at Legends Sports Bar in Long Beach , near his home . <EOS> The booth had its own television , silently rebroadcasting an N.F.L . <EOS> preseason game as Cunningham spoke . <EOS> He never glanced at it . <EOS> <EOP> He made it plain that he was not becoming an antifootball evangelist . <EOS> The sport ’ s long-term success hinges on moving more urgently toward safety , especially at the youth and college levels , he said . <EOS> He has pointed suggestions on ways to make the game safer . <EOS> <EOP> But he grew weary of watching players be removed from the field on carts with little ceremony . <EOS> ( “ We come back from the break and that guy with the broken leg is gone , and it ’ s just third-and-8 , ” he said . ) <EOS> He increasingly heard about former players , including former teammates and peers , experiencing the long-term effects of their injuries , especially brain trauma . <EOS> <EOP> “ I know a lot of people who say : ‘ I just can ’ t cheer for the big hits anymore . <EOS> I used to go nuts , and now I ’ m like , I hope he gets up , ’ ” Cunningham said . <EOS> His eyes welled with tears . <EOS> “ It ’ s changing for all of us . <EOS> I don ’ t currently think the game is safe for the brain . <EOS> And , oh , by the way , I ’ ve had teammates who have killed themselves . <EOS> Dave Duerson put a shotgun to his chest so we could study his brain . ” <EOS> <EOP> Duerson was a teammate of Cunningham ’ s with the Phoenix ( now Arizona ) Cardinals in 1992 and 1993 . <EOS> He killed himself in 2011 and was posthumously found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or C.T.E. , the debilitating brain disease that scientists say is caused by hits to the head . <EOS> It has been discovered in the brains of more than 100 former N.F.L . <EOS> players . <EOS> <EOP> Cunningham was also a professional teammate of Andre Waters in Arizona , and he has vivid memories of being humiliated in his first college start by the future Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau . <EOS> Waters and Seau killed themselves and were later found to have C.T.E. , too . <EOS> <EOP> “ This is as personal as it gets , ” Cunningham said . <EOS> “ I ’ m not hypothesizing here . ” <EOS> <EOP> Cunningham displays none of the Alzheimer ’ s-like symptoms that cripple many of those who are later found to have C.T.E. , which can be diagnosed only posthumously . <EOS> He said he recently went through testing that revealed no signs of brain problems . <EOS> <EOP> He was in the prime of his career as a broadcaster , and most likely could have continued to make a comfortable living doing it for decades . <EOS> <EOP> “ You could put him on any game , and you knew he ’ d be rock solid and prepared and opinionated and smart and thoughtful , ” said Lee Fitting , an ESPN senior coordinating producer who oversees college football coverage for the network . <EOS> “ He was always one guy you never worried about . <EOS> He ’ s a consummate professional . ” <EOS> <EOP> Cunningham , too , spoke glowingly about ESPN and the job he left behind . <EOS> <EOP> “ I was being paid a really nice six-figure salary for not a lot of days of work , and a live television gig that , except for nonsports fans , people would beat me up to take , ” Cunningham said . <EOS> “ I ’ m leaving a job that ’ s great . <EOS> It ’ s not kind of good . <EOS> It ’ s great . ” <EOS> <EOP> ESPN laid off dozens of on-air employees in April , but Cunningham was not among them . <EOS> As the news broke that day , and Cunningham learned of colleagues losing their jobs , he made the decision that had been percolating in his mind for several years . <EOS> He called and resigned . <EOS> <EOP> At first , Cunningham told ESPN executives that he was leaving to spend more time with his sons , ages 3 and 5 , and because of his workload as a film and television producer . <EOS> He was a producer for “ Undefeated , ” a documentary about an urban high school football team , and has a string of projects lined up . <EOS> <EOP> “ Those are two of the issues , ” Cunningham said . <EOS> He waited weeks before he revealed the third . <EOS> “ The big one was my ethical concerns . ” <EOS> <EOP> A football broadcaster leaving a job because of concerns over the game ’ s safety appears to have no precedent . <EOS> <EOP> “ I ’ ve been in the business 20 years and it ’ s the first time I ’ ve ever heard of anything like that , ” Fitting said . <EOS> “ But this is the world we live in now . <EOS> More and more players are stepping away in a given season or a given year , and who knows . <EOS> Are there other announcers out there who have been afraid to do this ? <EOS> I don ’ t know . <EOS> Is he going to be a pioneer in this small niche ? <EOS> I don ’ t know . <EOS> Who knows what the future holds . ” <EOS> <EOP> If nothing else , Cunningham ’ s decision could prompt some self-examination among those who watch , promote , coach or otherwise participate in football without actually playing it . <EOS> <EOP> Al Michaels , the veteran broadcaster who does play-by-play for NBC ’ s Sunday night N.F.L . <EOS> broadcasts , said he did not see his role in the booth as an ethical dilemma . <EOS> <EOP> “ I don ’ t feel that my being part of covering the National Football League is perpetuating danger , ” he said in a phone interview . <EOS> “ If it ’ s not me , somebody else is going to do this . <EOS> There are too many good things about football , too many things I enjoy about it . <EOS> I can understand maybe somebody feeling that way , but I ’ d be hard-pressed to find somebody else in my business who would make that decision . ” <EOS> <EOP> Those especially close to Cunningham were surprised only by the timing . <EOS> <EOP> “ He had certainly broadly hinted at it , ” Patrick said . <EOS> “ But I thought it was maybe two or three years down the road . ” <EOS> <EOP> Certain episodes Cunningham watched from the broadcast booth stick with him . <EOS> Ten years ago , he was quoted in The New York Times for an article about college players returning to games after sustaining concussions . <EOS> One of the cases involved the Stanford quarterback Tavita Pritchard , who was injured during a game against Notre Dame that Patrick and Cunningham broadcast . <EOS> <EOP> “ Announcers are part of the industrial complex of college football , and I think we ’ ve turned a blind eye toward the violence — we have to protect these kids , ” Cunningham said at the time . <EOS> <EOP> Cunningham , now a decade older , recounted that episode , among many others . <EOS> <EOP> “ That ’ s 10 years before I walked away , right ? ” he said . <EOS> “ What took me so long ? ” <EOS> <EOP> The last straw , he said , was working the Outback Bowl in December , when he saw the Iowa quarterback C.J . <EOS> Beathard hobbled , taking hits and being left in the game until the final two minutes of a 30-3 blowout loss to Florida . <EOS> Beathard went on to be taken in the third round of the N.F.L . <EOS> draft by the San Francisco 49ers . <EOS> The bowl game ( “ a game that means less than zero , ” Cunningham said ) still rankles Cunningham . <EOS> <EOP> “ I know some of the coaches from that team , known them for years , ” he said . <EOS> “ And it was hard for me not to walk down after the game and just say : ‘ Dudes , what are you doing ? <EOS> Really ? <EOS> What are you doing ? ’ These are just kids . ” <EOS> <EOP> Cunningham teared up again . <EOS> “ I get emotional , ” he said . <EOS> <EOP> He said he hoped being publicly forthcoming about his rationale for leaving the broadcast booth would further the conversation about football safety . <EOS> His desire , though , is not to undermine the game but to help it . <EOS> <EOP> “ I think people are starting to think , What should we do here ? ” Cunningham said . <EOS> “ You can ’ t throw out everything . <EOS> You can ’ t say it ’ s all broken . <EOS> You have to change the paradigm . <EOS> How should it be different 20 years from now ? <EOS> It ’ ll be different , and I think quite a bit different . <EOS> And that ’ s O.K . ” <EOS> <EOP> Among his ideas : No contact before high school . <EOS> Limit the number of plays per game in which a player may participate , something like a pitch count in baseball . <EOS> Tougher rules , and even in-helmet sensors , for players who dip their heads to tackle . <EOS> And changes to substantially soften the exterior of football helmets , into something more like memory foam , to reduce the weight and its utility as a weapon . <EOS> <EOP> Cunningham is happy to talk about all of that . <EOS> He just will not be doing it through a microphone while sitting in a booth high above a football field . <EOS> He has seen enough . <EOS> ",0
General Kelly is 'approving some of Trump 's tweets ',"His new rule has been that all White House business must go through him . <EOS> <EOP> And it seems not even the president is exempt from the rules of General John Kelly 's regime . <EOS> <EOP> According to unnamed staffers , Trump has agreed to show his tweets to his new Chief of Staff before posting them in a bid to hit the right tone after months of administration chaos . <EOS> <EOP> Several sources told Bloomberg on Sunday that while General Kelly does not tell the president what to do or write , he has been helping Trump rephrase his tweets to avoid further controversy . <EOS> <EOP> The president insisted on having the final say over what he can and can not post but the sources said he is taking General Kelly 's opinion seriously . <EOS> <EOP> Over the weekend , while staying at Bedminster , New Jersey , the president fired off his signature string of Saturday and Sunday morning posts . <EOS> <EOP> They were less inflammatory than in weeks past when he insulted the Chinese and called Congress 'fools ' who were being laughed at . <EOS> <EOP> Earlier in the day , White House Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney said anyone who attempts to describe the full outcomes of tax reform `` is lying to you '' because so many of the details have yet to be hammered out or negotiated . <EOS> <EOP> `` We Democrats sent a letter to the Republican leadership and the president , said that here were three things that we thought tax reform ought to have , '' Schumer began while speaking on CBS ' `` Face the Nation .

PETA : Cheese Is Sexist,"Because according to PETA , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , cheese is the most sexist thing you can eat . <EOS> The innocent-looking piece of Provolone on your sub sandwich or wedge of Brie at cocktail hour is actually the “ product of imprisonment , rape , reproductive control , kidnapping , and abuse . ” <EOS> <EOP> In its never-ending quest to equate animal rights with human rights ( founder Ingrid Newkirk ’ s famous quote is “ a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy ” ) , PETA now claims cows are raped to produce the milk that ends up in your mozzarella . <EOS> The group posted a video on its website ( credited to a Brazilian affiliate ) showing various clips of animal brutality including “ cows who are imprisoned on dairy farms [ that ] are forcibly impregnated through artificial insemination again and again on rape racks . <EOS> Rape racks . <EOS> All for your milk , cheese , and yogurt. ” Stopping this practice , the group suggests , is as important as stopping “ sex trafficking , slavery , genital mutilation , and honor killings . ” <EOS> <EOP> PETA urges folks to go vegan to end sexism : “ Help end violence , reproductive control , and rape of females of animal species who desperately need us to speak up for them . <EOS> Try delicious plant-based milk , vegan cheese , and dairy-free yogurt . <EOS> Our vegan mentors can answer your questions and help you leave sexism off your plate . ” <EOS> <EOP> PETA is desperate to curb an uptick in U.S. dairy consumption over the past 20 years . <EOS> According to the latest data from the Department of Agriculture , Americans ate 627 pounds of milk-based products apiece in 2015 , up from 570 pounds in 1995 . <EOS> Yogurt consumption more than doubled and sexist cheese-eating increased by 40 percent . <EOS> ( I can only imagine the surge since Trump was elected . ) <EOS> <EOP> Adding full-fat dairy , eggs , and butter to your diet is back in fashion as nutritional science continues to debunk the lousy dietary advice we have been fed the past few decades , which is to replace animal by-products with carbohydrates . <EOS> PETA can see the writing on the barn wall and is now trying to halt a continued rise in dairy consumption by making you a rape accomplice when you sprinkle parmesan on your pasta . <EOS> <EOP> I asked two women in dairy farming for a response to PETAs accusations . <EOS> Joanna Lidback is a mom of two and runs a dairy farm in northeastern Vermont where they milk about 60 cows . <EOS> “ Cow health and comfort is the number one concern for farmers , many of whom also happen to be women , ” Lidback told me . <EOS> “ They are trying to paint a picture of cattle that equates them to humans . <EOS> They are not forcibly impregnated , they are in heat and biologically ready to be impregnated. ” She said there is no such thing as a rape rack : “ That ’ s a term created by vegan/animal activists . <EOS> Of course there are no rape racks . ” <EOS> <EOP> Jodi Venema DeHate is a technician for the Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program and assists dairy farmers in part of that state . <EOS> She explained that many dairy farmers use artificial insemination to protect their cows . <EOS> “ Bulls are very large , close to a ton when fully grown . <EOS> An average cow is 1,500 to 1,800 pounds , so a bull mounting a cow can cause damage to the cow since he ’ s so large. ” Apparently , bulls are not exactly the sweetest farm animal to have around , either . <EOS> “ Bulls are also territorial and get mean fairly quickly , ” DeHate said . <EOS> “ Bulls are good at breeding cows but are just not very nice to the farmer . ” <EOS> <EOP> It ’ s a little ironic for PETA to cry sexism about cheese-eating , since the group was recently accused of exploiting women and using “ sexist marketing techniques ” during a promotion at Wimbledon last month . <EOS> In a July 3 press release , PETA-UK said , “ Today , decked out in 1950s-style swimsuits , two sexy PETA models handed out cups of strawberries and vegan cream to the crowds queuing for Wimbledon. ” The women wore bikinis and high heels ; the stunt was roundly criticized by activists on social media . <EOS> <EOP> The head of PETA-UK , Elisa Allen , defended the move . <EOS> “ We are an organization founded , directed , and largely staffed by women . <EOS> We are all feminists but not prudes , ” she told the Daily Mail . <EOS> “ And we believe a woman has the absolute right to use her body in any way she chooses , without a father , brother , or anyone else telling her to cover up . <EOS> It is important to recognize that sexual does not mean sexist. ” So asking women to walk around a public event half-naked and offer cream to get men ’ s attention is not sexist but eating cheddar is . <EOS> Got it . <EOS> <EOP> Of course , this is just one example of the Left ’ s reflex to “ ism ” every thought , comment , or action . <EOS> At the same time , it diminishes the real meaning of the word “ rape ” and equates a dairy cow being inseminated with your daughter being sexually assaulted . <EOS> That ’ s enough of a reason to do exactly the opposite of what PETA demands . <EOS> Go order some extra cheese on that pizza . <EOS> <EOP> READ MORE : <EOS> <EOP> White Skittles : LGBT Support Gets Skittles Accused of Racism <EOS> <EOP> Social Justice Warriors : Veganism ‘ Erases ’ Trans People <EOS> <EOP> Harriet Harman ’ s Wedding Had No Cake . <EOS> You Know , to Fight the Patriarchy <EOS> ",0
"'US in grip of anti-Russia hysteria , worse than days of Salem witch trials ' - analyst","The whole 'Russia thing ' is due to the neocons who are looking for another Cold War because it is very profitable for them , Daniel McAdams , executive director of the Ron Paul Institute , told RT . <EOS> <EOP> Twitter has published a report on how the company battled against alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election and also mentioned RT . <EOS> <EOP> In the report , Twitter revealed confidential information to the US Senate on RT 's advertising outlay . <EOS> <EOP> But meetings have been taking place in recent weeks about the future of the program . <EOS> Attorney General Jeff Sessions , historically a longtime opponent of DACA , discussed the program at the White House with officials late last week , and the Department of Homeland Security says the program has come up in multiple meetings in recent months . <EOS> The agency has maintained it is not preparing for particular scenarios , but rather standing ready for when the President makes his decision . <EOS> <EOP> Trump has issued a shutdown threat if government funding , which runs out at the end of next month , does not provide for a wall . <EOS> <EOP> The company claims over a thousand tweets , `` definitely - or potentially - targeted the US market . '' <EOS> <EOP> RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan , however , pointed out that all media outlets spend money on promoting themselves . <EOS> <EOP> If the September 5 deadline is n't met , Texas would ask the court to add DACA to that challenge , which would force the administration to decide whether it will defend DACA in court . <EOS> That responsibility would fall to Sessions ' Justice Department . <EOS> <EOP> “ Somehow it did not cross our mind that in a developed democracy , regular media advertising can be considered suspicious or detrimental activity , ” Simonyan said . <EOS> <EOP> RT : How credible do you think these allegations are , given the US media is n't naming its sources ? <EOS> <EOP> Daniel McAdams : I think the whole story has already fallen apart for the most part . <EOS> At first , it was the Russian government spent a $ 100,000 on Facebook ads to support President Trump . <EOS> Well , that completely fell apart . <EOS> So they started saying that this troll army somewhere in St. Petersburg spent this money . <EOS> That ’ s never been shown to anyone , that ’ s never been proven , that ’ s speculation . <EOS> We ’ ve never seen any of the ads . <EOS> Some of them we are told are pro-Hillary , some are anti-Hillary ; some are pro-Trump , some are anti-Trump . <EOS> <EOP> The President has wavered on the program , from pledging on the campaign trail to end it immediately to calling it a `` very , very hard '' choice in recent months and telling The Associated Press that recipients of DACA should `` rest easy . '' <EOS> <EOP> I don ’ t even know what they are trying to say . <EOS> But we do know one thing ; we do know that Senator ( Mark ) Warner from Virginia went out on Facebook three times … demanding they find some evidence of Russian meddling in the elections . <EOS> Three times he went out there and threw his weight around . <EOS> They finally came up with something that ’ s probably the most cockamamie thing I ’ ve ever heard in my life ; it ’ s not passing the laugh test . <EOS> People like Robert Parry have already debunked it in Consortiumnews . <EOS> Frankly , without any evidence , it is just a laughable story . <EOS> <EOP> When the Obama administration instituted the deferred action program in 2012 , critics , including then-Sen . <EOS> Sessions , blasted the move as an executive overreach . <EOS> The Trump administration , largely through chief of staff John Kelly when he was serving as DHS secretary , has prodded Congress to come up with a permanent solution for the program , which would answer the complaints of it being done through presidential authority . <EOS> <EOP> RT : Why do you think Russia is the first to blame here ? <EOS> <EOP> DM : The US is now in the grips of the kind of mass hysteria that we ’ ve certainly not seen since the height of the Cold War , maybe even going back to the Salem Witch Trials , where complete irrationality has taken over . <EOS> If it is a cloudy day – it must be the Russians involved . <EOS> It is absolutely hysterical . <EOS> Let ’ s not forget , Media Matters is a news organization founded by David Brock , a radical ‘ Hillaryite , ' which is itself a prime creator of fake news in support of Hillary . <EOS> <EOP> The whole Russia thing is the neocons who are dying for another Cold War because it is very profitable for them to have a Cold War . <EOS> The neocons have made an unholy alliance , an unholy marriage with the dead-ender Hillaryites to blame everything on the Russians to gin up a Cold War , to make the neocons even richer and to make the Hillaryites feel less bad that their candidate was a lousy candidate who lost . <EOS> That is why we see everything blamed on the Russians . <EOS> If there was some evidence , perhaps we could have a conversation , but right now it ’ s just hysteria . <EOS> <EOP> Four different proposals have been introduced in Congress to offer some permanent protections to the so-called `` Dreamers '' under the program , two bipartisan , one Republican and one Democratic . <EOS> <EOP> RT : It ’ s said in the statement that Twitter revealed confidential information on RT 's advert expenses to the US Senate . <EOS> Could you comment on that ? <EOS> <EOP> Nearly 800,000 young , undocumented immigrants have benefited from DACA , which protects children who were brought to the US illegally from deportation and offers them the ability to work , study and participate in their communities without fear . <EOS> Many have known no other home besides the US . <EOS> Applicants must meet certain criteria , pass a background check and maintain a clean record . <EOS> <EOP> DM : I don ’ t see why the information is confidential . <EOS> If it is something as grave and as serious as the Russians actively purchasing Facebook ads of all things to change the election around , why shouldn ’ t we be able to see what they did ? <EOS> What do they have to hide ? <EOS> Why wouldn ’ t you simply show the evidence ? <EOS> My guess is because they haven ’ t seen it themselves ; they can ’ t understand it ; they are not tech people ; and possibly that there really isn ’ t any evidence there… They don ’ t want the American people to scrutinize it . <EOS> When they actually did come out with a report around the turn of the year – the report on Russian meddling – the evidence was so absolutely absurd . <EOS> Things like ‘ RT was covering Occupy Wall Street ( OWS ) . ’ Well , everybody was covering OWS . <EOS> They had stories about how the elections might not be fair – everyone has those stories… <EOS> <EOP> RT : Do you think these adverts , supposedly used by trolls , could have really turned the tide of the US election ? <EOS> <EOP> DM : We ’ re supposed to believe with this $ 100,000 on Facebook… We need to look at the states , where President Trump won that he was not expected to win . <EOS> That is the margin of difference . <EOS> It is not the over popular vote . <EOS> It is specific states – like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - where the president did better than expected , and it put him over the edge in the electoral vote . <EOS> We ’ re expected to think that a blue color worker in Pennsylvania was frustrated at the stagnating economy , is sitting there at his computer , and all of the sudden logs into Facebook and sees an ad that makes him jump up and say : “ You know what , I ’ m gon na go vote for Donald Trump. ” We ’ re supposed to accept that that happened millions and millions of times – to get enough people to make the changes that had Trump elected president . <EOS> It is astronomical stupidity to suggest . <EOS> This is a billion dollar election . <EOS> Anyway , even if everything was true , and some Russian wasted $ 100,000 on Facebook ads – it would not be enough to have a significant effect on the guys sitting in there in Pennsylvania , sitting there in Wisconsin , who made up their minds to go with the economic nationalism of Donald Trump , promising to bring jobs back , versus Hillary Clinton… <EOS> <EOP> But conservative states are trying to force Trump 's hand to sunset the program by September 5 . <EOS> That 's the deadline in an ultimatum issued by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other state attorneys general to the Trump administration . <EOS> They 've asked the administration to rescind DACA by then or they will challenge it in an unfriendly court . <EOS> <EOP> RT : In your opinion , is Russian intelligence generally capable of meddling in the election in such a way that it could make a real U-turn in US presidential elections ? <EOS> <EOP> The administration has been reviewing its options on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program for months -- opting to continue the Obama administration policy when it took office despite Trump 's bellicose campaign rhetoric . <EOS> The review has intensified in recent weeks , as an ultimatum looms after Labor Day to force the administration 's hand . <EOS> <EOP> DM : Let ’ s just assume that Russian intelligence is behind this . <EOS> The Russian intelligence not only would have to know the electoral system better than Americans , but they would also have to know what ’ s in the hearts and minds of the American people who voted for Trump or for Hillary . <EOS> This must be the most incredible intelligence service , incredible bureaucracy in the history of the world , that they are inside the minds of these Americans and able to somehow turn a switch and have them do this or that . <EOS> If that is the case – then we ’ re all doomed , because they have the superpowers . <EOS> ",1

Maine Gov . Tells Sheriffs They 'll Be Fired for Defying U.S. Immigration Officials,"On Tuesday , Republican Maine Gov . <EOS> Paul LePage warned his state ’ s sheriffs that he ’ ll fire anyone who defies his order to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement officials . <EOS> <EOP> In a letter to Maine ’ s sheriffs , LePage explicitly threatened to remove any sheriff who refuses to comply with Immigration Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) requests to extend the detention of arrested individuals suspected of violating federal immigration law . <EOS> <EOP> The governor ’ s letter was prompted by rouge sheriffs who have said they won ’ t comply with ICE requests , The Daily Caller reports : <EOS> <EOP> The letter , which references LePage ’ s authority to dismiss Sheriffs who defy his orders , appears to be directed at Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce . <EOS> Joyce informed ICE in a Sept. 14 letter that he would not comply with requests to detain arrested individuals beyond their scheduled release date , absent a warrant . <EOS> “ We have a couple sheriffs who say they ’ re not going to be working with ICE , ” LePage told [ Radio Host Laura ] Ingraham . <EOS> “ Well , unbeknownst to them , the Maine Constitution says if they don ’ t follow state law , that I can remove them . <EOS> So there ’ s likelihood you ’ re going to be hearing some stories about sheriffs being removed from their duties . ” <EOS> <EOP> Inexplicably , Trump chose to host Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and ambassador Sergey Kislyak the day after he fired Comey in a maze of conflicting explanations ( when none , by the way , was required ) . <EOS> Naturally , this further fueled the Trump-Russia conspiracy narrative . <EOS> The president first told his guests that the former FBI director – a decorated former prosecutor and investigator who has spent most of his professional life trying to protect the United States from terrorists , hostile governments , and criminals – was “ crazy , a real nut job. ” Remarkably , Trump then managed to top himself , adding that by firing Comey , he had “ taken off ” the “ great pressure ” he faced “ because of Russia . ” <EOS> ",1
"Woman interviews 100 rapists , finds almost no remorse","Anyone interviewing 100 convicted rapists would no doubt have a few things to say . <EOS> <EOP> But what Madhumita Pandey , an Indian master ’ s student , has to say might surprise you . <EOS> <EOP> When Pandey was just 22 she visited Tihar Jail in the Indian city of New Delhi to work on her thesis . <EOS> <EOP> With over 10,000 inmates , it is the largest prison system in South Asia . <EOS> <EOP> It was after the highly publicised and brutal gang rape of a woman referred to as Nirbhaya ( meaning “ the fearless one ” ) in 2012 when Pandey was inspired to better understand the attitudes of men that commit rape . <EOS> <EOP> In an interview with The Washington Post , Pandey discussed her findings and how she even felt sorry for some of them . <EOS> <EOP> “ After you speak to [ the rapists ] , it shocks you — these men have the power to make you feel sorry for them . <EOS> As a woman that ’ s not how you expect to feel . <EOS> I would almost forget that these men have been convicted of raping a woman . <EOS> In my experience , a lot of these men don ’ t realize that what they ’ ve done is rape . <EOS> They don ’ t understand what consent is , ” she said . <EOS> <EOP> Not only do the men not understand what consent is , the majority of the prisoners she spoke to were largely uneducated — most hadn ’ t even completed three years of schooling . <EOS> <EOP> Some were so unaware that what they were doing was wrong that Pandey revealed less than five percent had expressed remorse . <EOS> <EOP> Even when they were remorseful , their attempts at repenting often made matters worse . <EOS> <EOP> One rapist , referred to by Padney as participant 49 , particularly stuck in the now-26-year-old ’ s mind . <EOS> <EOP> After raping a five-year-old girl for “ provoking ” him , the 23-year-old prisoner told Pandey he would fix the situation by marrying the child when he got out of prison . <EOS> <EOP> It ’ s only been five years since the rape , meaning the child is only 10 . <EOS> The man is due for release in five years . <EOS> <EOP> Pandey asked the man if he felt bad . <EOS> <EOP> “ Yes , I feel bad , I ruined her life . <EOS> Now she is no longer a virgin , no one would marry her , ” he said . <EOS> <EOP> “ I would accept her , I will marry her when I come out of jail , ” he told her . <EOS> <EOP> After the rape of Nirbhaya in 2012 , Pandey , like most of the world , believed the men involved , and rapists in general , were monsters . <EOS> <EOP> “ When I went to research , I was convinced these men are monsters . <EOS> But when you talk to them , you realize these are not extraordinary men , they are really ordinary . <EOS> What they ’ ve done because of upbringing and thought process , ” she said . <EOS> <EOP> Studies show that in India more than 90 percent of rape cases go unreported meaning that the true number of rapes is far higher than the 35,000 officially reported in 2015 . <EOS> <EOP> Just yesterday , a 32-week-old baby removed from the womb of a 13-year-old Indian girl died after she was granted permission by the court to terminate the pregnancy to save her own life . <EOS> <EOP> The girl had been raped by her father ’ s colleague and the pregnancy only came to light because her parents had taken her to the doctor thinking she was obese . <EOS> <EOP> According to the BBC , a child under 16 is raped every 155 minutes in India while a child under 10 is raped every 13 hours . <EOS> <EOP> “ Everyone ’ s out to make it look like there ’ s something inherently wrong with [ rapists ] . <EOS> But they are a part of our own society . <EOS> They are not aliens who ’ ve been brought in from another world , ” Pandey said . <EOS> ",0

The first gun control victory in decades may be near,"Please share this on Facebook and Twitter so everyone can see what Al Sharpton had to say about ESPN and anchor Jemele Hill . <EOS> <EOP> Gun control proponents have had little luck over the past 23 years convincing Congress to pass legislation that would curb the use of guns or ammunition in the U.S . <EOS> <EOP> But the most recent deadly mass shooting has created rare common ground in the halls of Congress , and lawmakers in both parties say they are willing to consider legislation banning gun accessories known as `` bump stocks . '' <EOS> <EOP> The devices were used on at least a dozen guns in the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting that left 59 dead and hundreds injured . <EOS> <EOP> Funny , we don ’ t recall him saying something similar when right-leaning Curt Schilling and Mike Ditka were fired from ESPN for expressing their views , or longtime anchor Linda Cohn was suspended and Sage Steele threatened for speaking the truth about the network ’ s politicization , or anyone else on the right being bullied into silence by the left . <EOS> <EOP> Those remarks closely coincided with what Sharpton had told a reporter for TMZ Sports just days earlier , when he suggested press secretary Huckabee Sanders “ read the Constitution ” and said the civil rights community would “ stand up for ” Hill in her defense if she were to be punished . <EOS> <EOP> Bump stocks attach to semi-automatic weapons , allowing them to fire in rapid succession , much like automatic weapons , which are illegal outside of the military . <EOS> <EOP> White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the smears “ outrageous ” and — alluding to ESPN ’ s swift action against conservative-leaning employees who made controversial statements in the past — suggested Hill ’ s comments constituted a “ fireable offense . ” <EOS> <EOP> Lawmakers from the most pro-gun states say it is time to reconsider whether bump stocks should be legal . <EOS> <EOP> `` We need to have a hearing , '' Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , who is the Senate Majority Whip , told the Washington Examiner . <EOS> `` This bump stock , which most people never heard of , evades the restriction on automatic weapons . <EOS> That bears scrutiny . '' <EOS> <EOP> Sen. James Inhofe , R-Okla. , another strong gun rights proponent , said he would likely back a ban on bump stocks . <EOS> <EOP> According to Independent Journal Review , ESPN recently came under fire after one of their prominent anchors and commentators , Jemele Hill , engaged in a public Twitter rant that labeled President Donald Trump , his administration and his supporters as “ white supremacists , ” “ racists ” and hateful bigots . <EOS> <EOP> “ The thing that is dangerous about this that I think that people are missing , which is what many of us in the civil rights community are saying , is that if ESPN does this ( fire Hill ) , they ’ re going to face the wrath of a lot us , ” Sharpton told host Nicole Wallace . <EOS> <EOP> “ First of all , Sarah should read the Constitution , ” intoned Sharpton , “ she ( presumably meaning Hill ) has the first right amendment ( sic ) to give her view . ” <EOS> <EOP> Sharpton then stated that the White House calling for a person to be fired due to something they said constituted a civil rights issue , because they were “ robbing a person of their right to express their views , ” and insinuated that the Federal Communications Commission could be used to intimidate ESPN and Hill into silence . <EOS> <EOP> What Sharpton and the rest of those on the left seem to miss is that , far from demanding Hill be fired , Huckabee Sanders was merely suggesting that ESPN should take some sort of disciplinary action against her if they were to remain consistent in how they have previously dealt with employees expressing controversial opinions . <EOS> <EOP> Referring to ex-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick ’ s anthem protests and now Hill ’ s remarks , hypocritical Sharpton stated that we now live in a time where , “ people are punished for expressing their views . <EOS> Whether you agree with their views or not , you ’ ve got to respect them , and we can ’ t have a country where people ’ s jobs and livelihood is threatened because of their views . ” <EOS> <EOP> `` If it 's something that fits the definition of an automatic [ weapon ] , I probably would , '' Inhofe said . <EOS> <EOP> In an interview with Hugh Hewitt , Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , an avid hunter , also called for examining the legality of the bump stock . <EOS> <EOP> President Trump is `` open '' to reviewing the devices , spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said . <EOS> <EOP> Legislation is ready to go . <EOS> <EOP> Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , a staunch gun control proponent , introduced a bill last week banning bump stocks , which were legalized by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives in 2010 . <EOS> <EOP> Much has been said over the past few years about how ESPN has increasingly shifted to the left politically with their sports coverage , but if you want to understand why that shift has been made , look no further than Al Sharpton and the threat he issued in response to the network ’ s latest controversy . <EOS> <EOP> Feinstein has tried several times over the years to pass legislation limiting certain semi-automatic guns and high-capacity ammunition clips , pitching her measures following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the Orlando nightclub shooting , for example . <EOS> <EOP> Her latest bill is narrow , however . <EOS> It is limited to the bump stock devices . <EOS> The bill `` would ban the sale , transfer , importation , manufacture or possession of bump stocks , trigger cranks and similar accessories that accelerate a semi-automatic rifle 's rate of fire . '' <EOS> <EOP> Because it excludes additional gun control provisions , it has a chance , Republican leaders said , as long as Democrats do n't try to use the tragedy in Las Vegas to push for more expanded gun control provisions like they have insisted on following other mass attacks with guns . <EOS> <EOP> `` If people want to use it as a platform to restrict the rights of law abiding citizens , then we are not going to get anywhere , '' Cornyn warned . <EOS> <EOP> In a direct message to Hill herself , Sharpton stated , “ Stand strong . <EOS> If they take you out , many of us in the civil rights community will stand up for you and take ESPN off our service . ” <EOS> <EOP> Democrats are keenly aware of the dynamic and say they do n't plan to ask for more than the bump stock ban . <EOS> <EOP> At least , that is what Sen. Chris Murphy is promising . <EOS> <EOP> Murphy , D-Conn. , has become a leader on gun control legislation in the Senate Democratic Caucus . <EOS> He 's been on a mission to pass gun control measures since the Sandy Hook shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead from the gunshots fired by a mentally unstable young man . <EOS> <EOP> Sharpton then stated that because of the power of the government , such as the FCC and its control over cable networks , it was wrong for the White House to be “ intimidating ” ESPN and Hill ’ s First Amendment rights by suggesting that Hill suffer repercussions for her commentary . <EOS> <EOP> `` I think you have to walk before you run , and it has been a long time since we 've been able to get any bipartisan consensus on laws closing loopholes on gun statutes , '' Murphy told the Washington Examiner . <EOS> `` This would be a good start . '' <EOS> <EOP> Murphy has introduced a separate measure expanding background checks , but said he will not push for its inclusion in the bump stock legislation . <EOS> <EOP> `` I would certainly be for something narrow '' on bump stocks , Murphy said . <EOS> <EOP> The fate of the bump stock may have been decided on Oct. 5 , when the NRA issued a rare statement calling for an immediate federal review of the legality of bump stocks . <EOS> <EOP> As for the ludicrous notion of a potential boycott of ESPN by Sharpton and the civil rights community , we doubt it would even be necessary , but can ’ t help but chuckle that such action would only hasten the demise of the rapidly shrinking network that has polarized its audience in their attempts to cater to the far-left fringe at the expense of the rest of America . <EOS> <EOP> `` The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations , '' the NRA said in a statement . <EOS> <EOP> Republicans from pro-gun states wo n't have to worry about the wrath of the NRA if a bill banning bump stocks comes up for a vote . <EOS> <EOP> Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain , R-Ariz. , said banning bump stocks `` has merit , '' and he is not surprised by the sudden bipartisanship on a gun control measure , which has eluded Congress since Bill Clinton 's first presidential term . <EOS> <EOP> `` Look at Las Vegas , '' McCain said . <EOS> `` That is how I account for it . <EOS> Americans are horrified by it . <EOS> And they should be .

"AT & T joins tech giants in support of net neutrality , while also fighting the rules","On the eve of a net neutrality day of action , AT & T joined hundreds of other major internet companies to stage a protest billed as the “ Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality , ” despite fighting to kill those rules in the past . <EOS> <EOP> The largest telecommunications company in the world said it will join the protest to preserve and advance an open internet , according to a blog post written by AT & T Senior Executive VP Bob Quinn on Tuesday . <EOS> <EOP> “ This may seem like an anomaly to many people who might question why AT & T is joining with those who have differing viewpoints on how to ensure an open and free internet . <EOS> But that ’ s exactly the point , ” Quinn wrote . <EOS> “ We all agree that an open internet is critical for ensuring freedom of expression and a free flow of ideas and commerce in the United States and around the world . ” <EOS> <EOP> Quinn added that “ no company should be allowed to block content or throttle the download speeds of content in a discriminatory manner. ” However , Quinn also stated that the rules have created “ an environment of market uncertainty that does little to advance internet openness . ” <EOS> <EOP> In April , Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) Chairman Ajit Pai announced that the FCC will begin reversing net neutrality rules put in place under former President Barack Obama . <EOS> Pai argues that the rules were “ all about politics ” and proposed revising the rules that were in place before 2015 . <EOS> <EOP> The FCC adopted net neutrality rules in 2015 , which reclassified internet service providers ( ISP ) as “ common carriers ” under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 . <EOS> <EOP> Title II was created in the 1930s to regulate the Ma Bell telephone monopoly . <EOS> By applying these rules to ISPs , the FCC was given the authority to regulate the behavior of ISPs similar to utilities , subjecting them to more government oversight . <EOS> <EOP> Under the rules , ISPs are banned from selling “ fast lanes ” on the internet , or blocking internet traffic to certain sites , or otherwise prioritized internet traffic . <EOS> <EOP> In 2015 , AT & T filed a lawsuit against the FCC , arguing their decision to reclassify ISPs as common carriers was unconstitutional . <EOS> <EOP> In his blog post , Quinn claims that the rules “ subject broadband service to an 80-year-old law designed to set rates in the rotary-dial-telephone era. ” Rather than keeping the current rules in place , Quinn suggested that Congress should pass bipartisan legislation to “ provide the clear statutory authority that guarantees an open internet for all consumers . ” <EOS> <EOP> Comcast also posted a blog in support of “ permanent , strong , legally enforceable net neutrality rules. ” However , the ISP argued that “ Title II regulation and net neutrality are not the same thing . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ You can have strong and enforceable Open Internet protections without relying on rigid , innovation-killing utility regulation that was developed in the 1930s , ” David Cohen , Senior executive vice president of Comcast , wrote . <EOS> “ While some seem to want to create hysteria that the Internet as we know it will disappear if their preferred regulatory scheme isn ’ t in place , that ’ s just not reality . ” <EOS> <EOP> The ISP pointed out that the internet “ was fine before Title II regulation , ” citing a $ 1.5 trillion investment in broadband infrastructure , and a growing number of customers with access to high-speed internet before the 2015 rules were in place . <EOS> <EOP> While AT & T and Comcast supported net neutrality in part , other companies protested the rollback of net neutrality without any caveats . <EOS> Tech giants such as Google , Facebook , Amazon , and many other displayed banners on their homepages , wrote blogs , and posted links for users to file comments with the FCC . <EOS> <EOP> Google posted a blog of the text that was sent to the members of its “ Take Action ” community , encouraging users to share their views with the FCC . <EOS> <EOP> The company shared a link to the Internet Association ’ s net neutrality page , which explains the basics of net neutrality and directs users to the FCC ’ s comment section for the “ Restoring Internet Freedom ” proposal . <EOS> As of Wednesday afternoon , there have been more than 6.8 million filing posted on the proposal , which was announced in April . <EOS> <EOP> The founder and CEO of Facebook , Mark Zuckerberg , posted a message to his 93 million followers , saying he is “ open to working with members of Congress and anyone else on laws to protect net neutrality . ” <EOS> <EOP> Vimeo released their own video on Wednesday , explaining the basics of net neutrality and how to fight to ensure it remains intact . <EOS> <EOP> Yelp posted a blog , saying “ the internet belongs to billions of users around the world––not to a select few CEOs. ” The company also changed their logo to add a “ spinning wheel of death , ” signifying the slow access that users could experience if the FCC rolls back the regulations . <EOS> <EOP> Mozilla , the maker of Firefox , uploaded a nine-hour video with a narrator reading more than 40,000 pro-net neutrality messages the company has received , in a soothing voice . <EOS> <EOP> Tim Berners-Lee , the man credited with creating the world-wide web , released a video on Wednesday , saying , “ If we lost net neutrality , we lose the internet as we know it . ” <EOS> ",0

Last Chance for the Senate GOP Health Plan : Let the Arm Twisting Begin !,"Senate Republicans , depending on where they currently stand on their leaders ’ latest proposal in the battle to overturn the Affordable Care Act , will either spend their weekend having their arms twisted to support the Better Care Reconciliation Act , or being enlisted in the effort to twist their colleague ’ s arms . <EOS> Time is running short for the GOP to produce a budget reconciliation bill before the fiscal year ends on September 30 , and the next two months may represent the GOP ’ s last shot . <EOS> <EOP> The bad news is that , for reluctant Republicans , many of their concerns about the bill ’ s impact on low-income Americans have not been addressed by revised versions of the legislation . <EOS> Some , like Maine ’ s Susan Collins and Nevada ’ s Dean Heller , are concerned about the impact that the proposal ’ s cuts to Medicaid and its changes to the formulas used to calculate premium subsidies will have on the out-of-pocket costs that the poor have to bear . <EOS> <EOP> Related : Senate Republicans May Try to Skirt CBO Score on Health Bill <EOS> <EOP> An analysis by Loren Adler and Paul B. Ginsburg of the Brookings Institution , released this week , isn ’ t likely to make them more enthusiastic about the Senate bill . <EOS> <EOP> Adler and Ginsburg took the legislative language released by the Senate this week and translated it into dollars and cents for Americans across a range of age and income categories . <EOS> The results were plain . <EOS> Under the Senate GOP plan , low-income Americans who have to buy insurance on the open market would pay more for their coverage , in most cases much , much more . <EOS> <EOP> “ The most striking finding is that the BCRA would lead to a large increase in average annual health care costs for those with lower incomes , whatever their age and family type , ” they write . <EOS> <EOP> While the increased costs would be felt by Americans across most age and income brackets , it would be particularly pronounced for older Americans who are not yet eligible for Medicare . <EOS> <EOP> Related : McConnell Infuriates Some Conservatives by Preserving Two Big Obamacare Taxes <EOS> <EOP> “ For example , a 64-year-old couple earning a combined income of $ 28,000 would go from average annual costs equal to 13 percent of their income under the ACA up to 70 percent of their income under the BCRA , ” they write . <EOS> <EOP> “ The magnitude of this change stems in large part from the elimination of the ACA ’ s cost-sharing subsidies , which effectively reduce low-income enrollees ’ out-of-pocket costs , and that unsubsidized average out-of-pocket costs are particularly high for a 64-year-old couple . ” <EOS> <EOP> In fact , there is no income bracket for a 64-year-old couple making less than $ 100,000 per year in which health insurance coverage as a percentage of income would not rise under BCRA . <EOS> <EOP> The bill would result in modest premium decreases as a percentage of income for younger Americans . <EOS> A 21-year-old earning $ 30,000 per year or more would pay slightly less under the BCRA than under the Affordable Care Act . <EOS> <EOP> For a 40-year-old , the threshold is higher : It isn ’ t until income hits $ 60,000 per year that the percentage of income spent on health insurance under the BCRA falls below that spent under ACA . <EOS> And even then , the difference is tiny . <EOS> <EOP> One of the overarching goals of the GOP in assembling an Obamacare alternative was to lower consumers ’ insurance premiums . <EOS> If the Brookings analysis is correct , the bill currently under consideration succeeds , but only for a smaller , and relatively more wealthy segment of the population . <EOS> ",0
Buffett partner Charlie Munger says Al Gore is ‘ an idiot ’ but became rich with this strategy,"Warren Buffett 's top lieutenant , Charlie Munger , told a small group of investors that the simple strategy of buying only service company stocks made former Vice President Al Gore very wealthy . <EOS> <EOP> `` Al Gore has come into you fellas business . <EOS> ... <EOS> He has made $ 3 or $ 400 million in your business . <EOS> And he 's not very smart , '' Munger said at the Daily Journal annual meeting on Feb. 15 . <EOS> `` He had one obsessive idea that global warming was a terrible thing . <EOS> … So his idea when he went into investment counseling is he was not going to put any CO2 in the air .

"House passes $ 4.1 trillion budget , the first concrete step toward tax reform","The House narrowly passed a $ 4.1 trillion budget on Thursday , formally initiating a process that Republicans hope will result in the enactment of major tax reform later this year . <EOS> <EOP> The final tally was 219-206 . <EOS> More than a dozen Republicans voted with Democrats against the budget , objecting to elements of the spending package or to parts of the tax reform proposal . <EOS> <EOP> The budget contains $ 1.1 trillion in non-entitlement spending , including nearly $ 622 billion on defense . <EOS> <EOP> The Senate Budget Committee was expected to pass a similar budget later in the day , with a vote in the full Senate slated for the week of Oct. 16 . <EOS> <EOP> By passing a budget resolution through both GOP-controlled chambers , Republicans would trigger a legislative process known as reconciliation , during which they could pass a sweeping tax reform bill with a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate , instead of the usual 60-vote requirement . <EOS> <EOP> Democrats unanimously opposed the resolution , which House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , labeled `` a vehicle for achieving partisan tax reform .

Trump sent 'private messages of appreciation ' to Mueller,"Donald Trump has reportedly been sending 'private messages of 'appreciation ' to special counsel Robert Mueller . ' <EOS> <EOP> The president , who previously branded the investigation a 'witch hunt , ' appears to be on surprisingly good terms with Mueller , who was appointed to investigate whether Trump 's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia . <EOS> <EOP> 'He appreciates what Bob Mueller is doing , ' Trump 's chief counsel John Dowd told USA Today . <EOS> 'He asked me to share that with him and that 's what I 've done . ' <EOS> <EOP> Dowd added that Trump 's legal team had passed on his messages expressing 'appreciation and greetings ' to the special counsel . <EOS> He added the messages had been 'back and forth ' . <EOS> <EOP> Yet in public , Trump has been extremely critical of the executive branch investigation . <EOS> <EOP> Last month , the New York Times even reported that Trump was on a mission to find dirt on Mueller to discredit him . <EOS> <EOP> Those sources said that the president 's team is hard at work trying to prove conflicts of interest among Mueller 's team of investigators and hopes to thwart the entire investigation by forcing those investigators to recuse themselves . <EOS> <EOP> Attorney Jay Sekulow , a member of the president 's external legal team - which is not involved - told The Associated Press that the lawyers 'will consistently evaluate the issue of conflicts and raise them in the appropriate venue ' . <EOS> <EOP> The president has publicly stated his belief that Mueller 's team is compromised . <EOS> <EOP> He is now relying on his team of lawyers and representatives to find damaging proof of his suspicion , the Times reported . <EOS> <EOP> The request has however pushed Mark Corallo , the spokesman for the legal team going up against Mueller to step down , the sources said . <EOS> <EOP> Mueller , a former FBI director who served a decade and was then reappointed by Barack Obama , was appointed to lead the probe into Russian collusion after the Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from it and in the wake of Trump 's firing of the most recent FBI director , James Comey . <EOS> <EOP> Trump told The New York Times last month that he would consider it a 'violation ' if Mueller began probing his family 's finances as part of his investigation . <EOS> <EOP> The White House stood by Trump 's warning to Mueller not to cross a 'red line ' by probing his own personal finances . <EOS> <EOP> Speaking from the White House podium at an off-camera briefing , spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not dispute the president 's claim that it would be a 'violation ' if Mueller were to probe alleged Trump financial ties to Russia . <EOS> <EOP> 'The president is making clear that the special counsel should not move outside of the scope of the investigation , ' Sanders said last month . <EOS> <EOP> She said the president had 'no intention ' of firing Mueller , although she said he has the right to do so . <EOS> <EOP> She went on to say that the president is frustrated ' with the 'witch hunt ' of the Russia investigation . <EOS> <EOP> Mueller 's Russia probe is casting a wide net that examines an array ofTrump business transactions – exactly the direction the president said in a new interview would be a 'violation .

Seattle mayor accused of sexual abuse by several men,"SEATTLE — A lawsuit filed Thursday accuses Seattle Mayor Ed Murray of sexually molesting a teenage high-school dropout in the 1980s , and in interviews with The Seattle Times , two other men claim he abused them . <EOS> <EOP> Rich Higgins , a top official of the National Security Council was fired last month after arguing in a memo that President Trump is under sustained attack from subversive forces both within and outside the government who are deploying Maoist tactics to defeat President Trump ’ s nationalist agenda . <EOS> “ Globalists and Islamists recognize that for their visions to succeed , America , both as an ideal and as a national and political identity , must be destroyed , ” the memo warns . <EOS> It argues that this has led “ Islamists [ to ] ally with cultural Marxists , ” but that in the long run , “ Islamists will co-opt the movement in its entirety. ” “ Because the left is aligned with Islamist organizations at local , national , and international levels , recognition should be given to the fact that they seamlessly interoperate through coordinated synchronized interactive narratives … These attack narratives are pervasive , full spectrum , and institutionalized at all levels . <EOS> They operate in social media , television , the 24-hour news cycle in all media and are entrenched at the upper levels of the bureaucracies. ” Higgins , seen as an ally of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon , had only served on the council for a couple months . <EOS> Higgins had also “ pushed for declassification of documents having to do with radical Islam and Iran , ” according to a source close to the White House . <EOS> A source close to Higgins said that specifically , Higgins had been pushing for the declassification of Presidential Study Directive 11 , a classified report produced in 2010 by the Obama administration which presaged the Arab Spring , outlining unrest throughout the Middle East . <EOS> The directive has become a shibboleth of activists such as Frank Gaffney , who see it as evidence of the Obama administration ’ s links to the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups . <EOS> Higgins , according to another source with direct knowledge of the incident , was called into the White House Counsel ’ s office the week before last and asked about the memo . <EOS> On July 21 , the Friday of that week , he was informed by McMaster ’ s deputy Ricky Waddell that he was losing his job . <EOS> <EOP> The mayor denied the allegations through his personal spokesman Jeff Reading . <EOS> <EOP> “ These false accusations are intended to damage a prominent elected official who has been a defender of vulnerable populations for decades , ” said a statement issued by Reading . <EOS> “ It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline . <EOS> These unsubstantiated assertions , dating back three decades , are categorically false . ” <EOS> <EOP> Murray was elected mayor in 2013 after a long career in the Legislature , where he led efforts to legalize gay marriage in the state . <EOS> As mayor he pushed to increase the city ’ s minimum wage to $ 15 an hour and address the homelessness crisis in Seattle . <EOS> <EOP> In the lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court , a 46-year-old man , identified only by the initials , D.H. , said Murray “ raped and molested him ” over several years , beginning in 1986 — when he was 15 and addicted to crack cocaine , and when Murray was in his early 30s . <EOS> <EOP> And so McMaster purges another challenge to the Obama order . <EOS> And you have to wonder whether he is n't emerging as a national security threat . <EOS> <EOP> The man said he met Murray on a city bus , and Murray invited him back to his apartment , propositioning him for sex and haggling over the price . <EOS> <EOP> Murray paid him $ 10 to $ 20 for each of at least 50 encounters over the next four to five years , the lawsuit said . <EOS> <EOP> “ I have been dealing with this for over 30 years , ” the man , now sober for a year , told the Times . <EOS> <EOP> And why was Harvey fired ? <EOS> <EOP> He said he was coming forward as part of a “ healing process ” after years of “ the shame , the embarrassment , the guilt , the humiliation that I put myself through and that he put me through . ” <EOS> <EOP> The man also said his father ’ s recent death freed him of a desire to keep the abuse secret . <EOS> <EOP> The newspaper also reported that two other men said they knew Murray when they lived in a Portland , Oregon , center for troubled children . <EOS> Jeff Simpson and Lloyd Anderson accused Murray of abusing them in the 1980s and paying them for sex and said they ’ d be willing to testify about it , the Times said . <EOS> <EOP> Political warfare includes both non-violent and violent actions working in synthesis , Higgins says . <EOS> The left , with enemy-friendly Muslim Brotherhood allies , is able to control the dominant cultural narrative with the media and the government , blinding us in the war on terror and impacting how Americans think , he argues . <EOS> Higgins calls for a “ strategic and operational pause ” in America ’ s misguided battle to stop the terror . <EOS> He would , instead , ask new leadership to develop a comprehensive political warfare plan , while removing the subversive policies and personnel causing America to lose this paramount battle . <EOS> He cites the “ purges ” carried out by law enforcement and intelligence officials throughout government , which Phil Haney , Sebastian Gorka and Steve Coughlinhave made public . <EOS> <EOP> The Times said one of them talked with a social worker and detective at the time . <EOS> No charges were filed and an entry in an old Multnomah County district attorney ’ s database indicates the office considered but rejected a felony third-degree sodomy case in May 1984 . <EOS> Any other police and child welfare records would have been destroyed by now , officials said . <EOS> <EOP> Simpson and Anderson raised the allegations a decade ago in calls to reporters and Washington state lawmakers , and they repeated them in recent interviews with the Times . <EOS> <EOP> “ The two older accusations were promoted by extreme right-wing anti-gay activists in the midst of the marriage equality campaign , and were thoroughly investigated and dismissed by both law enforcement authorities and the media , ” the statement said . <EOS> <EOP> Simpson , 49 , said Murray — whom he thought of as a father — raped him over several years , starting at age 13 , and in later years , paid him . <EOS> <EOP> “ I would really like for him to admit it and to take responsibility , ” Simpson told two Times reporters who visited him unannounced in Portland . <EOS> “ I don ’ t necessarily think that he destroyed my life but I believe a lot of the problems I have stemmed from this . ” <EOS> <EOP> Simpson tried to bring a lawsuit against Murray in 2007 , with Anderson ’ s support , but his lawyer withdrew from the case . <EOS> In 2008 , Simpson started calling media organizations and lawmakers in Olympia , saying Murray , then a state senator , was a pedophile who had sexually abused him . <EOS> <EOP> Before his political career , Murray — one of seven children in an Irish Catholic family — considered the priesthood . <EOS> He spent a year at a seminary in 1976 before studying sociology at the University of Portland , a private Catholic institution , according to news profiles . <EOS> <EOP> Having sex with a child under 16 — the age of legal consent in Washington in 1986 and today — constitutes rape of a child under state law . <EOS> The statute of limitations on any crime would have expired long ago . <EOS> <EOP> The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and says D.H. has not previously made any financial demands of Murray . <EOS> ",1

Boo Hoo ? NBA Star Kevin Durant Fights With Ex-ESPN Reporter Over Trump,"Former ESPN D.C. sports reporter Britt McHenry has said she ’ s having “ an awakening ” as a vocal conservative , and if her latest tweets and Instagram message are any indication , it ’ s safe to say she ’ s “ woke , ” as the hipsters say these days . <EOS> Last Friday afternoon , McHenry tweeted : <EOS> <EOP> “ If issue ( fairly ) is divisiveness in the USA , then use celebrity & platform to come together , ” McHenry tweeted . <EOS> “ Great leaders meet , not shun invitations to WH . ” <EOS> <EOP> McHenry was taking aim at NBA all-star Kevin Durant , who recently told ESPN ’ s Chris Haynes he wouldn ’ t be visiting the White House because he doesn ’ t respect President Donald Trump , “ …I don ’ t agree with what he agrees with , so my voice is going to be heard by not doing that. ” ESPN personalities like Stephen A. Smith hailed Durant : `` I completely applaud KD ; he 's absolutely positively on the money . '' <EOS> <EOP> When Durant got wind of McHenry 's tweet , he mocked her by writing “ Boo hoo . <EOS> Sad story , keep tellin me more . ” <EOS> <EOP> McHenry then tweeted back : “ Ok let ’ s discuss how a successful man such as yourself can show unity meeting w/ WH just 20 min from PG County , ” she wrote . <EOS> “ Your presence can inspire . ” <EOS> <EOP> To which Durant responded , but later deleted : “ By doing the opposite , I am inspiring more people… ” <EOS> <EOP> Clearly wanting to speak more about what was on her mind , McHenry needed more than the 140 characters Twitter allows . <EOS> Instead , she went to Instagram to dive deeper : <EOS> <EOP> “ Listen , I realize our country is divided right now…That ’ s why I think athletes who are loved and admired by many , should accept an invitation to the White House . <EOS> They should meet with those they strongly disagree with , express their concerns , and more importantly , be an example for our society that despite growing tension , we can find a way to come together . <EOS> There is no “ support for Trump , ” in this belief . <EOS> I love this country and admire the highest office in this land , despite personal beliefs of who should or shouldn ’ t hold it . <EOS> For the next 3 years , we need to find a way to coexist . <EOS> If our military members can take orders and put their lives on the line for their Commander-in-Chief , the least a superstar athlete can do is meet with them eye-to-eye and express their viewpoint . <EOS> Yes , I felt the same way about previous athletes skipping the White House . <EOS> I ’ m never going to back down in saying what I believe , and neither should any of you . ” <EOS> <EOP> He said the school had n't intended to honor her or `` endorse any of her words or deeds , as we do not honor or endorse any Fellow . '' <EOS> <EOP> Durant ’ s actions are part of the reason on why there is a divide in this country . <EOS> It ’ s called “ resistance ” – not just resistance against President Donald Trump , but resistance against anything that could or would make progress – like using your platform to spread unity instead of divisiveness . <EOS> ",1
I Was Just Instantly Un-Friended,"When I heard the news that House Republicans just passed a bill that , if it becomes law , will directly cause hundreds of thousands if not millions of preventable deaths , I posted on my Facebook feed , simply , “ And they call themselves pro-life . ” <EOS> <EOP> A dear friend commented angrily that , inter alia , “ Anything is better than Obamacare . <EOS> Anything. ” ( S ) he said something to the effect that the passing of the ACHA is a “ huge step forward for decency and fairness in America , ” and went on to complain about his/her current insurance costs . <EOS> <EOP> Clearly , ( s ) he has no idea what just happened . <EOS> <EOP> But , rather than get into a debate on a comment thread , I replied simply , “ [ Name ] , I love you dearly , but you ’ re wrong. ” ( S ) he responded , “ I ’ m not , but we ’ re all entitled to our opinions , no matter how wrong they are . ” <EOS> <EOP> Two minutes later , ( s ) he unfriended me . <EOS> <EOP> I guess this is the price we have to pay . <EOS> I ’ ve known for some time that this person ( and other members of his/her family ) have been marinating their brains in right-wing fan fiction for many years now , but I never once considered un-friending them or ending my relationship with them ( although , to be fair , I did hide their feeds so as not to see the propaganda they were propagating ; more on that presently ) . <EOS> Two of them , so far , have un-friended me , both on occasions when a non-right-wing ( or anti-Trump ) political view seeped into my feed . <EOS> <EOP> I ’ ve been trying for years to strike a balance between the love , affection , friendship and respect I have for my friends and acquaintances who happen to be steeped in right-wing politics ( see here and here , for example ) , and the distress I feel when I find that people I love discretely harbor some truly hateful , vicious , horrifying beliefs and attitudes , or are at least willing to disseminate the work of others expressing such . <EOS> That ’ s why I hide their feeds rather than un-friend them ; my love and affection for them is more important than my discomfort or revulsion at the propaganda , and when we meet or talk we just avoid the subject . <EOS> To quote Edward R. Murrow , I ’ d like to think that I ’ m “ one of those civilized individuals who [ does ] not insist upon agreement with his political principles as a pre-condition for conversation or friendship. ” ( emphasis added ) . <EOS> <EOP> But now I ’ ve been un-friended , twice , by members of the same family ; one because I made fun of Trump , the other because I told him/her ( s ) he was “ wrong ” to think that what passed today is — let alone that “ anything , ” or nothing , would be — “ better than ” the ACA , and that what House Republicans did was in any way a “ step forward ” on anything , let alone anything positive or praiseworthy . <EOS> <EOP> Apparently , we ’ re ” all entitled to our opinions , no matter how wrong they are . ” <EOS> <EOP> I don ’ t suppose there is one good answer for whether , when or how to maintain relationships with people ... and I don ’ t want to say “ ... who we disagree with politically , ” because it ’ s really not a matter of “ disagreeing ” ; it ’ s a matter of seeing , hearing and reading beliefs and attitudes that at best make me very uncomfortable , and at worst chill me to the bone , coming from people I love , care about , and/or respect . <EOS> It was a little jarring to be instantly un-friended like that , over what I didn ’ t think was a terrible insult or unforgivable transgression . <EOS> Maybe I ’ m wrong about that . <EOS> <EOP> I only pray that my now-former friend , and the rest of his/her family , are not among those that their heroes in Washington just voted to kill . <EOS> ",0
Feds : Dismissing Menendez Charges Could ‘ Legalize Pay-To-Play Politics ’,"NEWARK , N.J. ( AP ) — The judge in U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez ’ s corruption trial could rule on Monday to dismiss the bulk of the indictment against the New Jersey Democrat , a decision that prosecutors say could “ broadly legalize pay-to-play politics . ” <EOS> <EOP> After hearing six weeks of testimony and viewing dozens of emails and documents that prosecutors allege show Menendez schemed to help a wealthy friend in exchange for free plane rides and luxury hotel stays , jurors may never get to deliberate those points . <EOS> <EOP> That will depend on how U.S. District Judge William Walls decides on arguments by lawyers for Menendez and his longtime friend , Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen , to dismiss the case . <EOS> Lawyers on both sides are set to present additional arguments Monday morning before Walls decides . <EOS> <EOP> Mexico ’ s response to the president ’ s tweets was concise and consistent . <EOS> On Sunday night the foreign ministry issued a formal statement . <EOS> “ As the government of Mexico has always maintained , our country will not pay for , under any circumstances ... a wall or physical barrier built on US territory along the Mexican border . ” <EOS> <EOP> But the statement didn ’ t stop there , despite the American president ’ s insistence on the wall : <EOS> <EOP> The Mexican government takes this opportunity to express its full solidarity with the people and government of the United States for the damages caused by Hurricane Harvey in Texas , and express that we have offered the US government help and cooperation to be provided by different Mexican government agencies to deal with the impacts of this natural disaster — as good neighbors should always do in difficult times . <EOS> <EOP> On Sunday evening , the Dallas Morning News reported , Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray also spoke to Texas Gov . <EOS> Greg Abbott and verbally reiterated the country ’ s offer of aid . <EOS> <EOP> On Wednesday the Texas governor said his state would accept the offer . <EOS> <EOP> This will not be the first time Mexico has offered disaster assistance to the United States . <EOS> <EOP> In 2005 , following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina , the Mexican government sent soldiers , medical personnel , engineers , and aid to the stricken citizens of Louisiana and Mississippi . <EOS> They carried with them safe drinking water and food . <EOS> <EOP> As the Washington Post reported on Monday , “ By the end of their three-week operation in Louisiana and Mississippi , the Mexicans had served 170,000 meals , helped distribute more than 184,000 tons of supplies and conducted more than 500 medical consultations . ” <EOS> <EOP> At issue is a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned the conviction of former Republican Virginia Gov . <EOS> Bob McDonnell and narrowed the definition of bribery . <EOS> In recent months , it has led judges to throw out bribery convictions for three former public officials , including a U.S. congressman . <EOS> <EOP> After the prosecution rested its case and with jurors out of the room , Walls surprised some last week when he appeared to put to rest what was expected to be the trial ’ s central issue : whether Menendez ’ s meeting and interactions with government officials could be considered “ official acts ” under McDonnell ’ s new , narrower definition of bribery . <EOS> <EOP> Instead , he focused on the so-called “ stream of benefits ” theory , which in the past has held that a bribe doesn ’ t have to be made with the intent to prompt a specific official action . <EOS> <EOP> If the judge rules the theory can ’ t be applied to this case , it could cut out the heart of the 18-count indictment : the 12 bribery counts , six against each man ; the top count , conspiracy to engage in honest services wire fraud , and possibly three others . <EOS> <EOP> The judge indicated last week he would leave intact one count of making false statements against Menendez for not declaring Melgen ’ s gifts on his Senate disclosure forms . <EOS> <EOP> The indictment charges Menendez with accepted the flights on Melgen ’ s private plane and other gifts over a seven-year period in exchange for pressuring executive branch officials on behalf of Melgen in an $ 8.9 million Medicare billing dispute and a contested contract for port screening equipment in the Dominican Republic . <EOS> <EOP> Defense attorneys for Menendez and Melgen contend language in the McDonnell decision requires that an alleged bribe be given in exchange for an official taking an action — or agreeing to — on a specifically identified “ question , cause , suit , proceeding or controversy . ” <EOS> <EOP> Menendez attorney Abbe Lowell argued the prosecution used a “ mix and match ” strategy to pair up Melgen ’ s gifts with actions Menendez took over the years , without establishing direct connections . <EOS> <EOP> “ They are one , two years apart , ” he said . <EOS> “ Sometimes the bribe is allegedly for something three months before . ” <EOS> <EOP> In response , Justice Department attorney Peter Koski argued the Medicare dispute and the port contract were the “ identified questions ” and that a public official doesn ’ t have to specify how he will perform his end of the bargain . <EOS> <EOP> In a brief filed Saturday , prosecutors cited cases since the McDonnell ruling in which , they wrote , federal appeals courts have left the stream of benefits theory undisturbed . <EOS> <EOP> Invalidating it , they wrote , would “ jettison the vast majority of bribery prosecutions , and broadly legalize pay-to-play politics . ” <EOS> ",1

France ’ s Rightward Shift,"France — Fact is stranger than fiction . <EOS> In France , doubly so . <EOS> On the day I leave for Paris , the following headline adorns Le Monde ’ s front page : “ Fillon Received $ 50,000 to Introduce a Lebanese Industrialist to Putin . ” <EOS> <EOP> Alors . <EOS> A scandal to mar the French election . <EOS> Anything less and they wouldn ’ t really be trying , would they ? <EOS> Of all the world ’ s political gods , those that serve the French are the most puckish . <EOS> <EOP> And yet , the persistent rumors that have engulfed François Fillon are , in truth , the least interesting thing about this extraordinary election cycle . <EOS> That Fillon ’ s descent has left a gaping political void is interesting , certainly . <EOS> But what ’ s really fascinating is how it ’ s being filled . <EOS> Late last year , it seemed all but certain that France would have a sensible , center-right president of the sort you could take home to your mother . <EOS> Today ? <EOS> Heaven only knows . <EOS> <EOP> On paper , Fillon was perfectly placed . <EOS> He had the experience , having been prime minister under Nicolas Sarkozy , and he had the novelty value , having become the North Star of a new French conservatism that has embraced Catholicism in spite of laïcité , turned happily toward “ Anglo-Saxon ” free markets , and even rebranded its flagship party as “ the Republicans. ” In addition , he was well suited to bridge the gap between the sects in a country that remains as divided as ever — “ How , ” Charles de Gaulle asked , “ can you govern a country that has 246 different sorts of cheese ? ” — but has become steadily more right-leaning as the years have gone by . <EOS> Astonishingly for a French politician , Fillon is running on a platform would be familiar to voters in the United States : Inter alia , he wants to reduce the number of civil servants , abolish France ’ s “ wealth tax , ” abolish the 35-hour work week , reform the health-care system , and raise the retirement age ; and , while he has promised to protect the legal status quo , he is vocally pro-life and opposed to gay marriage . <EOS> For once , the stars seemed to have aligned : The most credible , electable option was also the most sound . <EOS> <EOP> But , damn those puckish gods , it was not to be . <EOS> And , alas , the alternatives to Fillon are markedly less appealing than is he . <EOS> There is Marine Le Pen of the Front National ( FN ) , who , despite having distanced herself from her father and swapped open-handed racism for implication-heavy populism , is still rather unpleasant . <EOS> There is Benoît Hamon , the most left-wing candidate within the Parti Socialiste , whose big ideas are to tax robots and to add a universal basic income on top of France ’ s creaking welfare state . <EOS> There is Jean-Luc Mélenchon , a cerebral left-leaner whose destiny is to be the best-spoken also-ran in French history . <EOS> And there is Emmanuel Macron , a self-described post-ideological moderate who is a leading contender for Luckiest Man in France . <EOS> <EOP> Macron , an independent with no party apparatus around him , is a former Rothschild banker who at one point seemed destined to be a footnote but after Fillon ’ s implosion is now the odds-on favorite to win the whole thing . <EOS> Perilously untested , chronically vacuous , and ostensibly tarred by his work under the incumbent president , François Hollande ( the most unpopular the Fifth Republic has ever had ) , Macron nevertheless seems set to take the lion ’ s share of a political middle that is sorely lacking in credible representatives . <EOS> Cosmopolitan , pro-immigration , and publicly insistent that “ there is no such thing as French culture , ” Macron is precisely of whom Marine Le Pen is thinking when she lambastes the “ savage globalization that has been a nightmare ” for France . <EOS> <EOP> Politically , France is in a bad place . <EOS> Under Hollande ’ s feckless leadership , the country has been attacked from both without and within and seen an average of 1 percent growth for almost half a decade . <EOS> Unemployment among 15-to-24-year-olds is now at a staggering 25 percent and has led to an exodus that has rendered London the sixth-largest French-speaking city in the world . <EOS> The reflexively proud French are no longer sure that they have a future . <EOS> They are afraid for their economy . <EOS> They are afraid of immigration . <EOS> They are afraid of technology . <EOS> There is , almost everywhere you go , a tangible sense of ennui . <EOS> It is an uncertainty that does not suit the people that produced de Gaulle . <EOS> <EOP> For the establishment , the consequences have been grim . <EOS> As The Economist put it , this year ’ s primaries brought a “ bonfire of the elites. ” To have a familiar name in 2017 — be it “ Hollande , ” “ Sarkozy , ” or “ Juppé ” — is to carry a heavy weight around your neck . <EOS> As in America , many voters are in a burn-it-down mood . <EOS> And without a strong , “ safe ” option that can hoover up the middle , the extremists and opportunists have pounced . <EOS> <EOP> Blame it on what you will — “ populism , ” “ nationalism , ” the revolt of the forgotten — the traditional French alliances are disintegrating before our very eyes . <EOS> Why is it that so many are so worried that , this time , the execrable Le Pen family might finally get its hands on power ? <EOS> Because , this time , the support is coming from a variety of different places . <EOS> The Front National has always had strongholds in the rural , revanchist South , but it is now converting the socialists in the Northeast , appealing to an unprecedented number of voters under 30 , and winning over some key blocs of social conservatives who would historically have gone elsewhere . <EOS> And , crucially , it is making its gains for a host of different reasons . <EOS> <EOP> As France ’ s flagship pollster , IFOP , has shown , there is agreement among fans of Le Pen and Co. that the streets are too dangerous and that there are too many immigrants . <EOS> But , outside that , the coalition is intriguingly divided . <EOS> For the young , the main issue is the economy — remarkably , between a quarter and a third of young voters now claim to support the FN . <EOS> In the South , it is culture and taxes that drive passions , as well as a latent opposition to gay marriage that its entrenchment in the culture and the law has not dispelled . <EOS> In the North , the stories echo those from the American Rust Belt : Having seen their industrial jobs disappear , lifelong left-leaners are looking elsewhere . <EOS> For the first time in their history , reports the news station France 24 , the FN ’ s politicos “ have been tailoring their message . ” <EOS> <EOP> Outside Marseille Provence airport , in France ’ s southernmost region , there are Le Pen posters on every pillar . <EOS> Some feature the veteran fascist Jean Marie Le Pen , and read Avec Le Pen . <EOS> Contre l ’ arnarque Européenne ! <EOS> ( With Le Pen , against the European scam ! ) . <EOS> Others show Jean-Marie ’ s daughter , Marine , and carry a populist slogan : Au Nom du Peuple . <EOS> Next to them are flyers for another hopeful , an anti-American conspiracy theorist named François Asselineau . <EOS> His taglines are more paranoid in nature — Suivez votre intuition ! <EOS> ( Follow your intuition ! ) <EOS> — and there is a contrived heroism in his language . <EOS> Participer à l ’ histoire ! <EOS> reads one of Asselineau ’ s affiches . <EOS> That ’ s History with a capital H , one suspects . <EOS> <EOP> Along both the Autoroute du Soleil and the hairpin roads that flirt with the imposing Mount Faron , this pattern continues . <EOS> For mile after mile I see craggy mountains of chalk and green ; the usual array of Tuscan-orange roofs ; and , everywhere , posters for the Front National . <EOS> In the South , this disposition seems to be more ideological than anything else , for there is little obvious poverty in this region . <EOS> ( A decade or so ago , my Malawian cousin was turned away from a restaurant in this area on the open grounds that she was “ noire. ” ) My fellow drivers are retirees , soccer moms , and businesspeople , and they are safely ensconced in Audis , BMWs , and Mercedes . <EOS> While rural , the area is no backwater . <EOS> Nearby Toulon has an important enough port to have hosted the scuttling of the French fleet in both 1942 and 1793 , and figures prominently in both Victor Hugo ’ s Les Misérables and Joseph Conrad ’ s The Rover . <EOS> <EOP> A few miles from the city border , I stop for a break at one of the many pizza places that litter the roadside . <EOS> The owner of the joint has pasted a Marine Le Pen poster onto an electrical box outside his property . <EOS> After ordering a Coke , I ask casually about the election : “ You think Le Pen has a chance ? ” <EOS> <EOP> This should have been a straightforward question . <EOS> Toulon , after all , has a long history with the Front : In 1995 , it was one of the four French cities that shocked the world by electing a Front National mayor . <EOS> And yet , to my immense surprise , I immediately regret the inquiry . <EOS> <EOP> “ Who wants to know ? ” the proprietor asks immediately , cocking his head to the side . <EOS> I tell him that I am a British journalist who lives in America , and that I ’ d seen his sign and been intrigued . <EOS> <EOP> “ What do they think in America ? ” he asks , trying to change the focus . <EOS> <EOP> I say that America probably hasn ’ t given the French election much thought , which is half true and half a dodge designed to leave me on the fence . <EOS> <EOP> “ D ’ accord , ” he says , deftly . <EOS> “ So what do you think ? ” <EOS> <EOP> I flirt with the idea of explaining that I loathe Marine Le Pen , that I ’ m one of those dastardly Anglo-Saxon Atlanticists , and that I haven ’ t truly liked a politician since Coolidge . <EOS> But , wanting to stay alive for a few more years , I think better of it , pay for the drink , and move on . <EOS> <EOP> An hour away in Orange , a similar dynamic obtains . <EOS> Once a major seat in the Roman Empire and home to the best Roman theater in Europe , Orange is another of the towns that elected a Front National mayor in ’ 95 . <EOS> This year , it will almost certainly go for Le Pen . <EOS> <EOP> In a backstreet near the center of town , I meet a man putting up flyers that are covered in tall capital letters : IMMIGRATION ! <EOS> TERRORISME ISLAMIQUE ! <EOS> FRANCE ! <EOS> <EOP> I introduce myself and again ask whether Le Pen has a chance . <EOS> <EOP> “ Oui , ” he says , looking around . <EOS> <EOP> I encourage him to say more . <EOS> As he speaks , I am again struck by how seedy the whole thing feels . <EOS> This is a man who is putting up political posters on the street , and yet his eyes dart nervously as he talks , he declines to give me his name , and he speaks of the candidate he supports as Mr. Rochester spoke to Jane Eyre about his wife . <EOS> The flyers behind him say “ For the people ! ” and , in this town at least , a majority of those peuple seem to agree with the complaints his literature is making in unabashed 60-point solid caps . <EOS> And yet he behaves like a naughty schoolboy who has been caught watching pornography in his bedroom . <EOS> The New York Times tells me that the Front National is “ no longer spat upon , ” and I see ample evidence of this . <EOS> Still , there ’ s a defensiveness at play in the South that smacks more of la résistance than la majorité . <EOS> <EOP> It is a different story in Hénin-Beaumont , a former mining town near the Belgian border that once reliably voted for the Parti Socialiste but has turned lately to the Front . <EOS> As of 2014 , Hénin-Beaumont has a Front National mayor , Steeve Briois . <EOS> In an interview with Paris Match , a town assemblyman described meetings under the mayor as a “ circus ” but conceded that Briois had been tactically flexible enough that “ a very large majority of the population has no objective reason to complain . ” <EOS> <EOP> Even the Communists are impressed . <EOS> Jacques — I ’ m calling him Jacques because he doesn ’ t trust me and won ’ t give me his real prénom — tells me that he is voting for Le Pen , whom he calls “ Marine , ” as if they are friends . <EOS> But , as a former member of the now-routed Parti Communiste , he also likes Benoît Hamon ’ s idea of taxing robots , which he regards as insidious traitors that are stealing human jobs . <EOS> Jacques seems smart and put together , and in trying to figure out how someone as lucid as he is could have arrived at the viewpoints he has , I have to remind myself that this is a country in which SWAT teams go on strike if they aren ’ t permitted to drink at lunch . <EOS> <EOP> Jacques is typical . <EOS> Writing from Paris in 2007 , Christopher Hitchens observed that “ there is a reason why the French Communist Party , which used to dominate the working class , the unions , and much of the lumpen intelligentsia , is now a spent force that represents perhaps 3 percent of the electorate . <EOS> And that reason , uncomfortable as it may be , is that most of the Communist electorate defected straight to the National Front. ” Indeed . <EOS> And in getting there , many have walked straight past center-right candidates such as Sarkozy and Fillon , just as many Rust Belt Americans skipped past Mitt Romney on the way to Donald Trump . <EOS> Realignments , lest we forget , tend to change things from the ground up . <EOS> <EOP> One can overstate the case . <EOS> Marine Le Pen is unlikely to become president of France , if just because the system is explicitly designed to prevent people like Marine Le Pen from becoming president of France . <EOS> According to polling aggregated by The Economist , Le Pen has an excellent shot of getting to the second round — a 93 percent chance , in fact — but after that her odds drop to just 5 percent . <EOS> The reason for this is simple : In the first round of French presidential elections , the sheer number of non-FN candidates serves to fracture the “ normal ” vote into small pieces . <EOS> In the second round , however , that vote regroups behind the most palatable non-FN candidate and vastly outstrips the FN ’ s 25 percent average . <EOS> <EOP> This is , make no mistake , a Good Thing . <EOS> Marine Le Pen is not her father , but she is not much better , all told . <EOS> Like Nigel Farage in Britain , she has a point on the EU , and she is sensible to express concerns about crime and immigration that nobody else will touch . <EOS> And yet she has an emetically close relationship with Vladimir Putin , takes skepticism toward immigration and trade to unpalatably farcical levels , and , as a Gaullist admirer of dirigisme , is no friend to the market reforms that France so desperately needs . <EOS> She is , in short , bad news . <EOS> <EOP> And yet that so many “ what if ? ” stories are being written in earnest should indicate that something is afoot . <EOS> The socialists are no longer winning their voters . <EOS> The young are becoming radicalized . <EOS> The political are giving up on politicians . <EOS> To combine a lack of economic growth with an impermeable elite class is , we are learning , to develop an especially toxic brew — especially when that elite class is perceived to disparage all that the voters hold dear . <EOS> And in France , of all places ? <EOS> <EOP> On the plane from New York , I am struck again by the chasm that has opened between the jet set and everybody else , and by the scale of the opportunity that has presented itself to the iconoclasts . <EOS> I am on a British airline , and the in-flight magazine is aggressively cosmopolitan . <EOS> The “ Editor ’ s Note ” celebrates , among other things , that a third of Londoners were born abroad . <EOS> The featured interviewee argues that British television should shed its famous and traditional period dramas in favor of shows about immigrants . <EOS> And the most prominent advertisement describes “ dual citizenship ” as “ the insurance policy of the 21st century. ” If “ globalization ” were to be parodied by the sharpest minds in the West , it would look a little like this . <EOS> This , to paraphrase an American refrain , is how you got Brexit . <EOS> It ’ s how you ’ ll get Frexit , too . <EOS> <EOP> Which brings us to Monsieur Macron , the likely next president of France . <EOS> There seems little doubt that , for now , the French will choose the bloodless option over the crazy option — as well they should . <EOS> But that Macron will likely prevail will make him no less bloodless , and that he will remain bloodless will , in turn , create a new set of frustrations in a French polity that is moving inexorably rightward . <EOS> Over dinner in Paris , an anti–Le Pen friend of mine puts it this way : “ There is no question that if we get Macron , we will get a Trump , because Macron is the worst possible person for this moment . ” <EOS> <EOP> And so he is , which is why even in Paris you see dismissive , desperate signs — Tous sauf Macron ! <EOS> ( “ Anyone but Macron ! ” ) — and why otherwise sober people are muttering about the coming end of the Fifth Republic . <EOS> Had his scandals never surfaced , one suspects that Fillon could have taken some of the sting out of this peculiar moment . <EOS> In his absence , there seems to be nobody else who can . <EOS> What that means for the French and their system remains to be seen . <EOS> <EOP> — Charles C.

Neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer resurfaces with Russian domain following Google and GoDaddy bans,"I do not see The Last Supper . <EOS> But I ’ m told that Barack Obama did , very recently . <EOS> He was in town to give a speech . <EOS> He saw the cathedral and The Last Supper . <EOS> <EOP> After being refused service by two domain registrars and a hosting provider , a notorious neo-Nazi site has apparently fled to a Russian domain and a new server host , with a backup on the dark web . <EOS> <EOP> I see an ad — a poster — I love . <EOS> It ’ s for a food store . <EOS> The poster shows a slice of cantaloupe — moist and delicious-looking . <EOS> The words are “ Più pulp , meno fiction ” ( “ More pulp , less fiction ” ) . <EOS> <EOP> The Daily Stormer came under fire following the events in Charlottesville , Virginia , over the weekend . <EOS> The neo-Nazi website had its account terminated with domain registrar GoDaddy on Sunday after Twitter users complained about a post lobbing insults and slurs at Heather Heyer , the anti-racism demonstrator who was killed in Charlottesville . <EOS> The website also quietly had its server hosting disabled by hosting company Scaleway . <EOS> And even though the website quickly moved to another domain registration company , Google , Google promptly terminated its account . <EOS> <EOP> Thus , heading into Tuesday , the site — founded by prominent neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin in 2013 — was essentially bouncing around looking for places to land . <EOS> It briefly attempted to gain hosting through a Chinese service provider at the URL DailyStormer.wang , only to quickly be taken offline . <EOS> <EOP> Next , the site attempted to set up shop on the dark web , using a .onion domain . <EOS> Websites on the dark web are hidden from search engines and can only be accessed by special browsers such as a Tor browser . <EOS> But the site ’ s move underground didn ’ t last long . <EOS> Currently its home on the dark web is a parked announcement that it has relocated to DailyStormer.Ru : <EOS> <EOP> The .ru domain in the URL isn ’ t exactly proof that the website is now hosted in Russia , because anyone can register a .ru domain . <EOS> A Whois lookup for the .ru site reveals that the controversial hosting proxy CloudFlare , which has refused to terminate its business relationship with the neo-Nazi forum , continues to mask the identity of the site ’ s true server host . <EOS> <EOP> In Milan , many things are closed on Sunday — which is annoying . <EOS> At the same time , I respect it , even admire it . <EOS> You know ? <EOS> <EOP> On the website , Anglin celebrated the site ’ s return with a litany of anti-Semitism and criticism of GoDaddy and Google , calling the latter an anti-speech site . <EOS> He also took the opportunity to deliver more insults against Heyer , whose memorial is today . <EOS> <EOP> La Scala is a very handsome building . <EOS> Nothing to sneeze at . <EOS> From the outside , I mean . <EOS> But when you walk in … <EOS> <EOP> Update : The Dailystormer.ru domain now appears to be offline as well ; the .onion domain accessible via Tor browser has not updated . <EOS> We are following developments and will update this article as new iterations of the site appear . <EOS> ",1
"No , Don ’ t Remove All ‘ Confederate Monuments ’","I must take exception to the sweeping nature of Rich Lowry ’ s column arguing in favor of removal of all “ Confederate monuments ” from everywhere but battlegrounds and cemeteries , even though I agree with many of his points and with a large portion of his ultimate goal . <EOS> I do agree that a considerable number of such statuary have well-merited historical associations with the advocacy of Jim Crow laws and the like , and that they should be not in general public places but only in battlegrounds and cemeteries ( if they are to remain standing anywhere at all ) . <EOS> <EOP> Yet , as I wrote with regard to the statues in New Orleans that now have been removed , different monuments were erected under different circumstances and for different reasons — and not all of them should be considered under the same criteria . <EOS> The famous statue there of Lee was erected in front of a cheering crowd that included numerous former union soldiers , under the aegis of a committee co-chaired by former Confederate General Beauregard — right around the time that Beauregard was publicly , and courageously , arguing for full integration of public spaces and schools and full rights of voting and citizenship for blacks . <EOS> Obviously , the Lee statue was no monument , when erected , to white supremacy , but rather a celebration of Lee ’ s cause of post-war reconciliation . <EOS> As for Beauregard , he also grew up in New Orleans and was a civic leader on numerous fronts both before and after the Civil War . <EOS> His legacy of civil engineering , railroad oversight , and ( in effect ) invention of New Orleans ’ famous streeetcar system is grounds enough to commemorate him completely apart from his role in the Civil War . <EOS> For those reasons and others , I argued that the statues of Lee and Beauregard should remain in their iconic places even if the other two controversial statues were taken down . <EOS> <EOP> I write this as one with a long record of fighting white supremacists and racists , as no great lover of the Confederacy , and as one who believes , and wrote , that the proper response to last weekend ’ s events in Charlottesville is to completely condemn the white supremacists without trying to assert ( im ) moral equivalence between them and the counter-protesters . <EOS> <EOP> As many others also have written , this is one time where the “ slippery slope ” argument also is definitely applicable : I do quite seriously worry that even before all the Confederate monuments are down , the media will be giving credence to leftist calls to remove anything that honors “ slave owners ” named Washington , Jefferson , and Madison . <EOS> <EOP> It was perfectly reasonable for the entrance to New Orleans ’ City Park to feature a statue honoring P. G. T. Beauregard , especially one that was a particularly fine and celebrated piece of sculpture . <EOS> In other cities , there may be other good reasons to retain statues of Confederate leaders in places where they have stood for decades — not because they are a symbol of white nationalism , but to insist that they are not such symbols and should not be hijacked by radicals on either side . <EOS> Each memorial has its own context , place , and meaning , and those who cherish history and public understanding thereof should want each statue judged , and its fate determined , upon careful consideration thereof . <EOS> ",0
"Paul Ryan , Mitch McConnell praise Trump 's move against Paris climate deal","House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that they back President Trump 's decision to pull America out of the Paris climate agreement , which Trump said circumvented the will of Congress because it was never ratified by the U.S. Senate like other treaties . <EOS> <EOP> `` The Paris climate agreement was simply a raw deal for America , '' Ryan , R-Wis. , said in a statement . <EOS> `` Signed by President Obama without Senate ratification , it would have driven up the cost of energy , hitting middle-class and low-income Americans the hardest . <EOS> In order to unleash the power of the American economy , our government must encourage production of American energy . '' <EOS> <EOP> `` I commend President Trump for fulfilling his commitment to the American people and withdrawing from this bad deal , '' Ryan said . <EOS> <EOP> McConnell , R-Ky. , said the move would help ensure an end to regulatory moves by the Obama administration that hurt U.S. energy production . <EOS> <EOP> `` President Obama made commitments in this deal based off a costly power plan that we knew at the time was on shaky legal ground , '' McConnell said in a statement . <EOS> `` By withdrawing from this unattainable mandate , President Trump has reiterated his commitment to protecting middle class families across the country and workers throughout coal country from higher energy prices and potential job loss .

Eid : How is the start of the Muslim festival determined ?,"The end of Ramadan is marked by the key religious holiday of Eid al-Fitr , in which Muslim families worldwide gather for the `` feast of breaking the fast '' . <EOS> <EOP> But for such a major global event , working out when it will happen is surprisingly complicated - as Ahmen Khawaja and Amir Rawash explain . <EOS> <EOP> As the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan approaches , many of the world 's 1.8 billion Muslims hope for clear skies , to give them a sign that it is time to get out their best clothes and begin the feast . <EOS> <EOP> Islam follows the lunar calendar , based on phases of the Moon . <EOS> Ramadan starts in its ninth month . <EOS> <EOP> Each year , the month begins around 11 days prior to when it started in the previous solar year . <EOS> <EOP> This is significant , as it has a large impact on how people experience Ramadan from year to year . <EOS> <EOP> Muslims fast during Ramadan , abstaining from food and drink from dawn to sunset . <EOS> <EOP> If the Islamic months were based on the solar calendar , with the seasons fixed , people living in certain parts of the world would always have Ramadan in summer , with long periods of daylight , while in other parts it would always have shorter winter days . <EOS> <EOP> By following the lunar calendar , every Muslim is given a taste of fasting in different seasons . <EOS> <EOP> The Eid festival falls on the first day of the 10th month of Shawwal . <EOS> <EOP> But within Islam there is debate over when this begins . <EOS> Muslims in most countries rely on news of an official sighting of the new Moon , rather than looking at the sky themselves . <EOS> <EOP> Some follow a set lunar calendar , while others use astronomical observations to announce the arrival of the new Moon . <EOS> There are also those who mark the new month only after personally seeing a crescent Moon in the sky . <EOS> <EOP> So Eid dates differ around the world , though they are usually within one or two days of each other . <EOS> <EOP> The president has also at times attacked Republican senators not on the committee , including Mitch McConnell , John McCain , Marco Rubio , Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski . <EOS> <EOP> Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump 's campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election . <EOS> Grassley 's committee also is looking into the matter , as are other congressional panels . <EOS> <EOP> The Kremlin denies any election interference . <EOS> Trump has dismissed the Mueller probe as a `` witch hunt '' and denies any collusion . <EOS> In the end , Mueller could end up clearing Trump and his aides of any wrongdoing . <EOS> <EOP> For example , authorities in Saudi Arabia - the birthplace of Islam , and dominated by Sunni Muslims - announce the start and end of Ramadan depending on testimonies of members of the public who observe the Moon by sight . <EOS> <EOP> Muslims in many other countries then follow suit . <EOS> <EOP> But Iran , which has a large majority of Shia Muslims , abides by a government announcement . <EOS> <EOP> Iraq , which has a Shia majority and Sunni minority , uses a mix of the two - the Shia following the influential cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani 's announcement , while the Sunni follow their own clerics . <EOS> <EOP> Both Sunni and Shia Muslims in Iraq celebrated Eid al-Fitr on the same day in 2016 for the first time in several years . <EOS> <EOP> Turkey , meanwhile , a country that is officially secular , uses astronomical calculations to decide the start and end of Ramadan . <EOS> <EOP> And in the rest of Europe , most Muslims wait for announcements by leaders of their own communities - though this may depend on observing the Moon in other Islamic countries . <EOS> ",1
Discrimination against Men at Google,"A male engineer at Google created a storm by arguing that men and women are deeply different and that the difference helps explain why women are less likely than men to work for Google and rise to the top there . <EOS> His statement has been met with anger and disbelief . <EOS> Google ’ s new vice president for diversity tried to calm the waters by refusing to provide a link to the offending post and declaring that she “ found that it advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. ” She continued , <EOS> <EOP> But this verbal smackdown was not considered sufficient in the Google cocoon of political correctness . <EOS> The engineer has now been fired . <EOS> <EOP> Changing a culture is indeed hard and uncomfortable , but so too is changing a worldview . <EOS> Central to the progressive/feminist worldview is the belief that men and women would make the same choices with regard to work and family life if they were not socially trained to do otherwise . <EOS> <EOP> I have a few questions for proponents of this view . <EOS> First , do you believe in evolution ? <EOS> Progressives will say yes . <EOS> Second , are you aware that the vast majority of evolutionary psychologists believe there are deep-seated sex differences that , on average , will lead men and women to make different decisions about work and family ? <EOS> <EOP> This statement will send progressives scurrying in search of dissenters who might enable them to avoid rethinking their worldview . <EOS> James Damore , the would-be anonymous former Google engineer , set forth some findings widely accepted among those who study sex differences . <EOS> Here is some of what he said : Women are relatively more attracted to occupations dealing with people ; men are relatively more attracted to occupations dealing with things . <EOS> Thus , a technology company such as Google will attract more men than women . <EOS> Men are also more concerned about achieving a high status within an occupation , in part because , when looking for a mate , high status in a partner is more important to women than to men . <EOS> Thus , on average , men will be more willing than women to endure long hours in stressful positions in order to achieve higher occupational status . <EOS> <EOP> I have recently set forth some equally important conclusions of those who study sex differences . <EOS> Women have a stronger desire than men to spend much of the day with their young children . <EOS> Therefore , mothers are much more likely than fathers to want part-time work . <EOS> This preference for part-time work is strongest among the best-educated mothers . <EOS> <EOP> In pointing out such facts , I will have no more influence on Google than James Damore , but in my comfortable retirement I will not have to look for another job . <EOS> Policies such as Google ’ s that favor women in hiring and promotion are everywhere — even at the National Science Foundation . <EOS> One writer noted that in 2004 , the NSF awarded half its fellowships for engineers to women . <EOS> That might sound fair , but women made up a significantly smaller fraction of applicants . <EOS> The men apparently weren ’ t quite good enough . <EOS> Yet the male applicants garnered 80 percent of the honorable mentions — a proportion more in line with their representation in their profession . <EOS> <EOP> Maybe these results had little to do with the caliber of the male applicants . <EOS> One past NSF president , Rita Rossi Colwell , gave speeches in which she said promoting diversity “ begins with guidance on grant proposals and extends every step of the way , as an element in the final evaluation of the work. ” Just last year the NSF initiated a new funding program to increase diversity in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics . <EOS> Like other initiatives , this one will run up against some politically incorrect facts : Parenthood makes talented women less career-centered and men more career-centered . <EOS> And far more men than women score at the very highest level in mathematical- , spatial- , and science-reasoning ability . <EOS> <EOP> Google ’ s vice president for diversity says Damore made “ incorrect assumptions about gender. ” He didn ’ t . <EOS> He presented scientific facts , not assumptions . <EOS> When will progressives and feminists be willing to face those facts ? <EOS> <EOP> Far fewer women than men want top engineering jobs . <EOS> Nevertheless , diversity agendas , as at Google , insist on gender equality in top jobs . <EOS> It stands to reason that some of the women achieving promotions as a result will be less worthy than the male applicants . <EOS> That hardly sounds like a recipe for business success — or , more important , for true respect between the sexes . <EOS> <EOP> READ MORE : <EOS> <EOP> Our Free Speech Culture Is Slipping Away <EOS> <EOP> The ‘ Anti-Diversity Screed ’ That Wasn ’ t <EOS> <EOP> Google Receives 95 Theses on Diversity and Inclusion <EOS> <EOP> — Steven E.

Frederica Wilson ( D- Fla. ) , who first exposed Trump ’ s insensitive comments on Tuesday . <EOS> <EOP> The President responded with a defensive tweet , calling Wilson a liar and implying he had taped the call . <EOS> <EOP> “ Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action ( and I have proof ) . <EOS> Sad ! ” <EOS> <EOP> But Wilson did not back down from her account , adding that Trump at one point could not remember the slain sergeant ’ s name . <EOS> <EOP> Trump says soldier killed in Niger 'knew what he signed up for ' <EOS> <EOP> “ It ’ s disgraceful for him to even tweet about this , ” she told CNN . <EOS> <EOP> What ’ s worse , Wilson added during an appearance on MSNBC , Trump forgot Johnson ’ s name during the call . <EOS> <EOP> “ She was in tears , ” Wilson , who represents parts of northern Miami , said of Johnson ’ s pregnant widow , Myeshia . <EOS> “ She was in tears and she said he didn ’ t even remember his name ! ” <EOS> <EOP> Trump , appearing at the White House during a meeting with the senate finance committee , sat with his arms folded across his chest as he again denied Wilson ’ s account of the call . <EOS> <EOP> “ Didn ’ t say what that congresswoman said . <EOS> Didn ’ t say it at all . <EOS> She knows it , ” Trump said . <EOS> “ And I ’ d like her to make the statement again because I did not say what she said . ” <EOS> <EOP> The President ’ s recollection of the call contradicted both Wilson and Jones-Johnson ’ s version of events . <EOS> <EOP> “ I had a very nice conversation with the woman , with the wife who sounded like a lovely woman , ” Trump said . <EOS> “ Did not say what the congresswoman said and most people aren ’ t too surprised to hear that . ” <EOS> <EOP> Khan family bashes Trump for silence at soldiers ’ deaths in Niger <EOS> <EOP> Among other things , Trump attacked the press Sunday for its coverage of a special election in Montana and for using anonymous sources . <EOS> ( The White House frequently provides sources on the condition of anonymity . ) <EOS> <EOP> “ I still stand by my account of the call b/t @ realDonaldTrump and Myesha Johnson . <EOS> That is her name , Mr. Trump . <EOS> Not “ the woman ” or “ the wife , ” she tweeted . <EOS> <EOP> The flare up comes as Trump faces criticism from those who say he didn ’ t reach out to the soldiers ’ families soon enough . <EOS> <EOP> Instead , Trump pointed to the death of Marine Lt. Robert Kelly , son of White House Chief of Staff John Kelly , who died while fighting in Afghanistan in 2010 . <EOS> <EOP> Trump , speaking Tuesday with Fox News Radio , claimed President Obama never called Kelly , then a Marine general . <EOS> <EOP> It ’ s unclear what the commander in chief was trying to say . <EOS> After scrapping the tweet , Trump encouraged his followers to try to complete his initial thought . <EOS> <EOP> He also insinuated that past Presidents did not reach out to families of fallen soldiers as often as he has . <EOS> <EOP> But The Associated Press found relatives of two soldiers who died overseas during Trump ’ s presidency who said they never received a call or a letter from him , as well as relatives of a third who did not get a call . <EOS> <EOP> Veterans groups said they had no issues with past presidents recognizing soldiers killed in action . <EOS> <EOP> “ I don ’ t think there is any president I know of who hasn ’ t called families , ” said Rick Weidman , co-founder and executive director of Vietnam Veterans of America . <EOS> <EOP> “ President Obama called often and President Bush called often . <EOS> They also made regular visits to Walter Reed and Bethesda Medical Center , going in the evenings and on Saturdays . ” <EOS> <EOP> Trump ’ s politicization of the situation prompted Karen Meredith , the Gold Star and Military Families coordinator for VoteVets , who lost her son , First Lieutenant Ken Ballard , in Iraq , to issue an impassioned plea . <EOS> <EOP> “ Mr . <EOS> Trump , stop . <EOS> Please , just stop . <EOS> Your actions and words on this entire matter of the fallen in Niger is disgraceful , and unbecoming of a President of the United States and Commander in Chief , ” she said Wednesday . <EOS> “ This is not about you , it is about them . <EOS> It is about all of us who lost our loved ones , in war . <EOS> For once in your life , please stop making everything about you . <EOS> For once in your life , at least pretend to know what empathy is . <EOS> For once in your life , at least try to care about other people and their feelings . ” <EOS> <EOP> He was undoubtedly about to bash the media for its “ coverage ” of his White House . <EOS> But the tweet was not deleted until shortly before 6 a.m. — more than five hours after the fumbled initial thought , and after more than 127,000 retweets . <EOS> <EOP> A GoFundMe page set up for Johnson ’ s family has raised more than $ 334,000 in less than 24 hours . <EOS> <EOP> Trump angry that NFL isn ’ t going to ‘ force ’ players to stand <EOS> ",1

Trump Just Blamed ‘ Both Sides ’ Again For C ’ ville . A Black GOP Senator ’ s Response Is Great,"A day after Donald Trump ’ s 40-minute Oval Office meeting with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina , who is currently the only African American serving in the Senate , the president told reporters aboard Air Force One on the way back from Florida what a “ great talk ” they had . <EOS> <EOP> Trump was using his recollection of the conversation with Scott to defend his much-maligned remarks after Charlottesville comparing the KKK , Nazi and white supremacist protesters to the counter-protesters , saying there were good and bad people on both sides . <EOS> <EOP> Despite the president ’ s memory of their conversation , Scott is not one of those . <EOS> <EOP> The Senator put out his own statement today in response to Trump ’ s version . <EOS> <EOP> “ In yesterday ’ s meeting , ” said Scott in his statement , “ Senator Scott was very , very clear about the brutal history surrounding the white supremacist movement and their horrific treatment of black and other minority groups . <EOS> … the KKK and white supremacist groups have been killing and tormenting black Americans for centuries . <EOS> There is no realistic comparison . <EOS> Period . ” <EOS> <EOP> Scott said he didn ’ t expect Trump to suddenly change , and praised him for supporting the Senator ’ s legislation , the Investing in Opportunity Act , but the message was clear . <EOS> <EOP> Trump has not changed and what he said about there being good and bad people on both sides still is wrong in the Senators view . <EOS> <EOP> The Senator ’ s statement did not make note that a photo with Trump released after the Wednesday meeting by the White House got his name wrong , identifying him as “ Tom ” instead of Tim Scott . <EOS> <EOP> As usual , that is not the only thing about the meeting Trump got wrong . <EOS> He likes to twist things to make himself the hero but in this case he shows once again he is still the same racist fool he has always been . <EOS> <EOP> Download our NEW Occupy Democrats app for your iPhone by clicking here or for your Android by clicking here . <EOS> <EOP> Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President ’ s crimes . <EOS> IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP ! <EOS> <EOP> `` He categorically denies being the individual concerned and has irrefutable proof that he was in the United States at the time of the incident . <EOS> ",1

Double Shooting At Daycare Center – Children Take Cover In Bathroom ( DETAILS ),"Seven children trapped inside a daycare center took refuge inside a bathroom after their teacher came under gunfire on Monday . <EOS> The incident took place at an in-home daycare in Chula Vista , California after a man who once lived at the residence came back to retrieve a mattress he ’ d left there . <EOS> <EOP> When the woman running the daycare argued back with the man , he became enraged , tried to set fire to the structure , and broke out the sliding glass door at the back of the property . <EOS> The woman ’ s assistant rushed the children , whose ages ranged from 1 to 8 , into a bathroom in the home so she could continue to deal with the suspect . <EOS> <EOP> That is when the suspect fired his weapon at the daycare owner , at which time , she returned fire . <EOS> Both shots missed their targets and no one was injured . <EOS> <EOP> The man , 36 year old Gustavo Sepulveda is the ex boyfriend of the daycare owner . <EOS> He was arrested , and is now facing possible attempted murder charges . <EOS> <EOP> When police arrived , the daycare owner had fled the home , leaving Sepulveda inside , where he set more than one fire . <EOS> Police were able to arrest the suspect and rescue the children from the bathroom without incident . <EOS> <EOP> The new rule reinstates the ability of nursing homes to require forced arbitration agreements , yet purports to provide important—but completely insufficient—patient protections aimed at increasing transparency of a forced arbitration agreement . <EOS> For example , the new rule would require that forced arbitration agreements be written in “ plain language ” and that residents acknowledge that they understand the agreements before signing . <EOS> Regardless of how plain the language is , as potential nursing home residents and their families are weighing their options for long-term care , they should not also be expected to contemplate whether such a grave harm could arise , let alone what avenue of recourse they would pursue in the event that it does . <EOS> Too often , only after a resident has suffered an injury or death do families truly realize the impact of the arbitration agreements they were forced to sign . <EOS> The only truly transparent arbitration agreement is one that is voluntarily signed , after a dispute has arisen . <EOS> <EOP> The current proposal would also override existing state law protections aimed at protecting nursing home residents from the enforcement of one-sided contracts more broadly . <EOS> CMS ’ proposed overreach would completely eliminate resident choice on the issue of forced arbitration , and actually reinforces the facilities ’ superior bargaining power over residents during the admissions process – a harm that CMS acknowledged two years ago . <EOS> <EOP> Perhaps most alarming in the current proposal is the elimination of the current resident protections which prevent a nursing home from forcing residents to sign arbitration agreements as a condition of admission , including , as the current proposal suggests , as a condition of continued residency . <EOS> This could permit the most unscrupulous facilities to threaten current residents with removal from a facility for failure to sign a forced arbitration agreement . <EOS> <EOP> All children were picked up by family members , and no one was hurt other than Sepulveda , who was treated for cuts to his hands and feet after breaking the sliding door . <EOS> ",1
Ex-Nixon staffer says Trump Comey claims shows he broke protocol,"President Trump ’ s claims that FBI Director James Comey personally assured him on three occasions that he was not under investigation broke specific government protocols — but the commander-in-chief won ’ t be likely to face any penalties , former President Richard Nixon ’ s White House Counsel told the Daily News . <EOS> <EOP> John Dean , the Nixon staffer who helped expose the Watergate scandal that took down his boss ’ presidency , explained that guidelines exist to prevent the kind of discussions Trump allegedly had with Comey , because such talks can give the appearance of impropriety . <EOS> <EOP> A 2009 Justice Department memo signed by former Attorney General Eric Holder mandated that any communications “ of that ilk ” between the White House and the Department of Justice have a “ very prescribed route , ” Dean explained . <EOS> <EOP> Specifically , all Justice employees , including the FBI director , have to communicate with the White House through the attorney general or deputy attorney general , who , in turn , have to go through White House counsel . <EOS> <EOP> One shortcoming of the guideline , however is that “ it ’ s only a norm . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ It ’ s not a rule or regulation or law , ” Dean said . <EOS> “ There ’ s no formal sanction for violating it . ” <EOS> <EOP> In his termination letter Tuesday to Comey , Trump claimed that the former director informed Trump `` on three separate occasions , that I am not under investigation . '' <EOS> <EOP> During an interview with NBC News Thursday , Trump elaborated , alleging that Comey told him once over dinner and two other times on the phone . <EOS> <EOP> “ I said , ‘ If it ’ s possible would you let me know am I under investigation ? ’ He said ‘ You are not under investigation , ’ ” Trump said — a clear violation of the specific required routes of communication . <EOS> <EOP> When two parties break the protocol , it still raises questions over whether “ impropriety and/or political pressure ” had occurred , Dean explained . <EOS> <EOP> “ The reason it was put in place is because not following it looks awful , ” he said . <EOS> “ And all sorts of negative prospects could come from violating it . ” <EOS> <EOP> Questions bound to arise after such improper discussions could include , “ Is there criminal intent ” and “ is it bound to obstruct an investigation , ” Dean said . <EOS> <EOP> “ In most instances you can call a dozen prosecutors and probably get the same answer : Was it wrong for Trump to ask if he was under investigation ? <EOS> The answer is probably ‘ no , ’ ” he said . <EOS> <EOP> “ But would it be wrong for him to say or imply : I do n't want you to stay at the FBI if you ’ re investigating me ? <EOS> You bet , ” he added . <EOS> <EOP> Trump ’ s firing of Comey — who was leading a probe into the Trump campaign ’ s possible Russia ties — drew immediate comparisons to Nixon ’ s “ Saturday Night Massacre , ” when the besieged President fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox in 1973 . <EOS> U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned the same night . <EOS> <EOP> The Watergate scandal had been ballooning for more than a year at that point , and it would only explode from there . <EOS> Less than a year after the `` massacre , '' Nixon resigned . <EOS> <EOP> Dean implicated himself and other Nixon officials in the Watergate investigation and served four months in prison for his role . <EOS> ",0
Struggle to sell Pence event tix leads to price plummet ...,"Because of a lack of demand , the Colorado Republican Party is offering a Groupon-like deal to see Vice President Mike Pence . <EOS> <EOP> Pence is the headliner for a party fundraiser Oct. 26 at the Denver Marriott Tech Center , where the lowest-priced tickets originally cost $ 275 . <EOS> <EOP> The party announced the event weeks earlier but struggled to sell the tickets available . <EOS> So now it ’ s lowering the cheapest ticket to $ 150 , a 45 percent discount . <EOS> A couple can attend with a two-for-one deal at the original $ 275 price . <EOS> <EOP> Colorado Republican Party Chairman Jeff Hays tried to put his best spin on the news , writing in an email Wednesday : “ Due to popular demand , we have made more tickets available at a new lower price. ” But the same invite later says space is limited . <EOS> <EOP> Daniel Cole , the party ’ s spokesman , clarified : “ We are hearing from a lot of people that they very much want to see the vice president but the tickets were too expensive . ” <EOS> <EOP> He added : “ We couldn ’ t fill the large room at that ticket level . ” <EOS> <EOP> The party initially indicated it planned to sell 800 tickets but later said the expected attendance is 400 , a goal it expects to meet . <EOS> The room holds 900 for typical banquet events , according to the hotel . <EOS> <EOP> Cole declined to release the number of tickets sold to date , adding that he never expected the event to sell out because of the size of the room . <EOS> And he disputed the idea that ticket sales were a reflection on the Trump administration . <EOS> <EOP> The move to add cheaper tickets creates another tier of seating . <EOS> The original $ 275 ticket is now reserved seating “ in the best locations , ” Cole said . <EOS> The new , lower price is open seating . <EOS> Both tickets include dinner . <EOS> <EOP> “ All Republicans want to see the vice president , and many Republicans can ’ t afford the $ 275 ticket , ” he said , citing grumbling online from party activists since the fundraiser was announced . <EOS> <EOP> The top ticket for the event is $ 10,000 and includes a VIP reception , premier seating and a photo opportunity with Pence . <EOS> All the proceeds for the fundraiser go to the state party . <EOS> <EOP> Tax reform and other legislative promises he 's made like Obamacare repeal will only happen , though , Trump said if the people demand . <EOS> <EOP> 'Everyone 's saying , `` What 's she doing up here ? '' <EOS> But I 'll tell you what , good woman , and I think we 'll have your support . <EOS> I hope we 'll have your support , ' Trump told the endangered Democrat from the podium . <EOS> <EOP> Often political fundraisers are designed to be exclusive events , Cole said , but in this case “ our aim is to satisfy both — to do as much fundraising off of it as we can at the same time as allowing as many people as possible to see the event . ” <EOS> <EOP> 'So , there 's a little bit of hope there that maybe those three and others will see the light and will be able to go back to their states and say to their constituents , `` We know you needed tax reform and tax relief and we delivered it to you , '' ' a senior White House official said of their refusal to sign the letter . <EOS> <EOP> The ticket discount didn ’ t escape the eye of the Colorado Democratic Party . <EOS> “ I think it ’ s another indication of a lack of enthusiasm — right on the heels of a weak fundraising quarter for Republican candidates in Colorado , ” said party spokesman Eric Walker . <EOS> ",1
The Uruguayan prison where inmates set up shop,"Every weekday morning , Cesar Campo wakes up , eats a quick breakfast and heads to work in a converted warehouse where he builds tables , chairs , bookcases and anything else that clients request . <EOS> <EOP> Close by , his neighbours make bricks , grow vegetables and run shops such as cafes , a bakery , a barber 's salon and a tattoo studio . <EOS> <EOP> All the workers are inmates living at Punta de Rieles , a progressive `` open '' prison just outside the Uruguayan capital , Montevideo . <EOS> <EOP> `` We never imagined we would have something like this , '' said Campo , 50 , who has spent 23 years behind bars for bank robbery . <EOS> <EOP> `` It 's a model prison which offers opportunities you do n't find anywhere else . '' <EOS> <EOP> With incidents of prison violence recently hitting the headlines around Latin America , particularly in Brazil where more than 100 people died in January alone in a series of riots , the liberal philosophy behind Punta de Rieles offers an alternative view of how correctional institutions can be operated . <EOS> <EOP> Its director , Luis Parodi , is a former schoolteacher who believes that `` if the context changes , the man changes '' and who runs his prison based on three fundamental elements : work , education and culture . <EOS> <EOP> `` We want to provide the best daily life possible , so prisoners can sleep peacefully and do not feel humiliated , scared or fearful , '' Mr Parodi told the BBC . <EOS> <EOP> By creating a `` village '' which mimics the outside world as closely as conditions allow , he hopes to ease the rocky transition when prisoners return to freedom . <EOS> <EOP> Many of the 630 inmates at Punta de Rieles are approaching the end of their sentences . <EOS> <EOP> With the national re-offending rate estimated at around 50 % , Mr Parodi often tells departing prisoners to `` call me before you think about stealing something '' , and gives out his personal phone number . <EOS> <EOP> Uruguay 's prison population has more than doubled since 2000 . <EOS> Prisons are currently 9 % over their capacity . <EOS> <EOP> In this nation of 3.4 million inhabitants , 10,416 people were serving custodial sentences in 2016 . <EOS> <EOP> In 2009 , a UN Special Rapporteur expressed concern about the country 's penitentiary system , describing `` sub-human conditions '' in which inmates at one prison were held `` like animals in metal boxes '' for nearly 24 hours per day . <EOS> <EOP> At Punta de Rieles , prisoners can circulate freely within the prison boundaries until 19:00 . <EOS> <EOP> Many use mobile phones to stay in touch with the outside world , and some are allowed tablets or computers . <EOS> <EOP> Inside the cells , which are typically shared between four people , they are allowed to have televisions , games consoles , refrigerators and musical instruments . <EOS> <EOP> Families can visit three times per week , and overnight stays have been allowed since 2015 . <EOS> <EOP> In many cases , family members assist inmates who run businesses which sell their wares outside , like Cesar Campo 's carpentry workshop . <EOS> <EOP> Of 38 active `` companies '' , 35 were started by prisoners themselves , and another is run by several former inmates who still return to work at the prison . <EOS> <EOP> All business owners pay a small tax , which is used to provide micro-credit loans for inmates opening a new venture . <EOS> <EOP> Successful start-ups are also registered with Uruguayan tax authorities , and Luis Parodi 's latest initiative enables prisoners to open bank accounts from inside . <EOS> <EOP> Another of Mr Parodi 's unconventional ideas was to create a security force comprised almost entirely of unarmed female guards . <EOS> <EOP> `` At first I was scared , but not for long , '' said Ines Marcos , who has been working at Punta de Rieles for three-and-a-half years . <EOS> `` I would n't say we 're like their mothers , but we give the right advice , like a guide or a sister who helps them out . '' <EOS> <EOP> Sport and cultural activities are offered to complement education programmes . <EOS> <EOP> A colourful music studio in the main cell block rumbles with noise at all hours of the day as bands practise . <EOS> <EOP> `` Instead of staying inside , cutting your arms or building up rage against the police , we do something positive , '' said Santiago Garrido , 28 , who plays in a rock group and teaches guitar to fellow inmates . <EOS> <EOP> `` It 's a way of channelling our energy . <EOS> If we did n't do this , our heads would be thinking about other stuff , '' he added . <EOS> <EOP> `` The need to save ourselves is fundamental . '' <EOS> <EOP> Garrido 's group is currently working on an album that will be recorded at a studio outside the prison . <EOS> <EOP> With members of a theatre workshop , he frequently performs at other penitentiaries and in public , including a show at the Uruguayan parliament last year . <EOS> <EOP> Adriano Baraldo , 29 , is an actor and singer who is serving a 19-year sentence for armed robbery . <EOS> <EOP> `` I recognise that I 've done bad things , '' he says . <EOS> <EOP> `` I should n't have left my children [ to grow up like ] orphans .

CN Tower climber passes frozen bodies from last year ’ s climb,"TORONTO – Only halfway up its 1,776 steps , one participant in the CN tower charity climb is already passing the frozen bodies of those who didn ’ t make it last year . <EOS> <EOP> “ It ’ s hard to see all those frozen bodies in their T-shirts and spandex shorts , ” said climber Laura Gregg , taking a brief second to make the sign of the cross over one of the route ’ s many ice mummies . <EOS> “ But there ’ s nothing you can do for them . ” <EOS> <EOP> Although the frozen , warped and sunbleached bodies of former climbers line the route to the CN tower ’ s summit , some aspirational drive still causes thousands to attempt the ascent every year . <EOS> <EOP> “ Man was meant to go beyond , ” said Clark Horner , keeping his grip on the banister in spite of all that the furious elements could do to dislodge him . <EOS> “ Ex-cel-si-orrrrrr ! ” <EOS> <EOP> Horner was then picked up by a slight draft , and flung down 1,342 steps to his death . <EOS> <EOP> While many wish the city would do something about all the bodies , experienced climbers say it ’ s too difficult and dangerous to bring them down , and that it ’ s the kind of funeral plot any true climber would die for . <EOS> <EOP> “ This is what Jimmy would have wanted , ” said Gregg , crouching beside the frost-scaled body of her late climbing buddy , as a bird tried to peck one frozen eyeball out of the corpse ’ s head . <EOS> “ To die in the pursuit of the extraordinary is no death , but an eternal life . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ Do you have any Gatorade ? <EOS> I ’ m pretty thirsty . ” <EOS> <EOP> If Gregg makes it to the summit alive , she says it will be an even greater personal achievement than the time she rode her bike from the lake all the way up to Yonge and St. Clair . <EOS> ",0
Ivanka Trump ’ s Investment Fund Of Foreign And Corporate Cash Sounds Awfully Familiar,"“ We forget in the United States how long it has taken us to make ‘ We the People ’ mean people like me . <EOS> And indeed , I do think that America was born with a birth defect ; it was slavery . <EOS> “ And so I do think that when we were finally able to deliver the promise of the Constitution to people like me , little girls growing up in Birmingham , Alabama , when finally my father was able to vote without difficulty , yes , it ’ s the second founding of America . <EOS> The first founding wasn ’ t quite complete . ” <EOS> <EOP> WASHINGTON ―Ivanka Trump , the president ’ s daughter and White House adviser , plans to start a fund to help female entrepreneurs worldwide , using money from private-sector donors and foreign governments . <EOS> <EOP> According to Axios , the first to report the first daughter ’ s plan , the fund will be run by the World Bank . <EOS> “ Canadians , Germans and a few Middle Eastern countries have already made quiet commitments , as have several corporations , ” Axios previously reported . <EOS> The fund will provide “ working and growth capital to small- and medium-sized enterprises . ” <EOS> <EOP> Details are scarce . <EOS> It ’ s unclear whether Ivanka Trump will personally raise money from foreign governments and private corporations , or whether the White House counsel has considered whether her involvement conforms to ethics rules . <EOS> <EOP> Nevertheless , the Ivanka Trump-World Bank fund sounds like it will mimic the work of a private organization that got a lot of ( bad ) publicity in 2016 : the Clinton Foundation . <EOS> <EOP> The Clinton Foundation , which former President Bill Clinton launched after he left the White House in 2001 , is a nonprofit that runs developmental programs and facilitates private-sector investment in such public initiatives as fighting HIV/AIDS , combating climate change , reducing the impact of preventable disease , and empowering entrepreneurs ― including women and girls . <EOS> The Clinton Foundation is funded largely by contributions from wealthy donors , corporations and foreign governments . <EOS> <EOP> The foundation was seen as a major conflict of interest for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton , whose critics claimed her decisions as secretary of state benefitted foundation donors . <EOS> <EOP> Donald Trump , during the campaign , called the Clinton Foundation “ the most corrupt enterprise in political history. ” He attacked Clinton as “ the defender of the corrupt and rigged status quo ” who spent her time “ taking care of donors instead of the American people . ” <EOS> <EOP> A Trump campaign ad assailed the “ staggering amounts of cash pouring into the Clinton Foundation from criminals , dictators , countries that hate America. ” Those supposed America-hating countries included the United Arab Emirates , Qatar , Bahrain and Saudi Arabia ― formidable U.S. allies in the Middle East whose citizens contribute to other charitable funds connected to powerful Americans . <EOS> <EOP> Ivanka Trump ’ s fund also sounds like an effort from the investment bank Goldman Sachs called 10,000 Women , which provides business education to women around the world to spur entrepreneurship . <EOS> Dina Powell , an Ivanka Trump confidante who now works for the White House , headed the Goldman Sachs effort since it began in 2008 . <EOS> ( Ivanka Trump ’ s chief of staff is Julie Radford , who previously ran Goldman Sachs ’ 10,000 Small Business initiative , which invested in small U.S . <EOS> businesses . ) <EOS> <EOP> Donald Trump also attacked Clinton during the campaign for her ties to Goldman Sachs , including a $ 225,000 speech she gave to bank employees after she resigned as secretary of state . <EOS> Trump ’ s administration now includes at least six former Goldman Sachs executives . <EOS> <EOP> UPDATE : 5:20 p.m. ― The White House said Ivanka Trump will have no major role in the fund , according to The Washington Post . <EOS> <EOP> Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter . <EOS> Each Sunday , we will bring you the best original reporting , long form writing and breaking news from The Huffington Post and around the web , plus behind-the-scenes looks at how it ’ s all made . <EOS> Click here to sign up ! <EOS> ",1
Job Creators Network Praise President Trump ’ s Middle Class Tax Cut Speech,"“ The President is siding with all American small business owners by aggressively pursuing tax cuts for entrepreneurs and hardworking taxpayers , ” said Alfredo Ortiz , Job Creators Network President and CEO Alfredo Ortiz . <EOS> “ We agree with the president – we want to create more jobs in America for Americans – and the best way to do that is to give badly needed tax relief to our small business owners who are responsible for nearly two-thirds of new job growth in this country . ” <EOS> <EOP> President Trump addressed a large crowd in Bismarck , North Dakota and outlined his administration ’ s vision for what he called “ the American plan . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ So we ’ re here today to talk about our plan to create a new age of American prosperity by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies and on our workers , ” Trump told the audience . <EOS> “ The taxes are crazy — the highest-taxed nation in the world . <EOS> We ’ re going to turn that around very quickly . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ By working together , we ’ re going to restore America ’ s competitive edge by passing tax cuts and reform that makes America the best place in the world to hire , invest , and to grow , ” the president said . <EOS> “ We love our country , we love our people , and we want to create more jobs in America , for Americans . ” <EOS> <EOP> Ortiz said all taxpaying Americans , regardless of their political affiliation , deserve to see their taxes lowered . <EOS> <EOP> “ Small businesses are owned by both Republicans and Democrats and they all need a tax break , ” Ortiz told Breitbart News . <EOS> “ A bipartisan strategy to pass tax cuts not only makes sense , but will be more politically feasible . <EOS> All small businesses need tax cuts , not just the ones with similar political ideologies . ” <EOS> <EOP> The president ’ s speech came on the heels of Job Creators Network ’ s newly launched multi-million dollar advocacy campaign on Tuesday to urge Congress to pass small business tax cuts . <EOS> The seven-figure campaign intends to educate Americans about how tax cuts help boost wages , jobs , and the overall economy . <EOS> <EOP> The new initiative boasts a new website , TaxCutsNow.com , Americans are urged to sign a tax cut petition , share a letter to Congress , and watch videos by small business advocates explaining why tax cuts are needed . <EOS> A nationwide advertising blitz is also underway , featuring talk radio and television commercials , and social media ads to encourage tax reform . <EOS> <EOP> One of Job Creators Network ’ s new commercials features La Huerta Grill & Market owner Laz Marquez explaining how the current tax code burdens and complicates his life as a small business owner . <EOS> <EOP> The organization ’ s new initiative is designed to put pressure on Congressional lawmakers to pass a tax cut bill by Thanksgiving and make it retroactive to January 2017 . <EOS> <EOP> Part of the campaign includes a nationwide “ Tax Cut Tour , ” which will begin on Sunday , September 10 with a massive event in Oklahoma City , OK . <EOS> The bus tour will conclude with a “ 15 % on the 15th Rally ” in Washington , D.C. , on September 15 , where legislators , several trade associations and headlined by economist Stephen Moore . <EOS> <EOP> TaxCutsNow.com provides a list of the locations for the bus tour . <EOS> <EOP> “ Job Creators Network ’ s Tax Cuts Now campaign provides this ammunition that is necessary to win the tax cut fight , ” Ortiz said . <EOS> <EOP> The national “ Tax Cut Tour ” will kick off on Sunday , September 10 with a massive event in Oklahoma City , OK . <EOS> ",0
De Blasio blames debate organizers for crowd 's partisan shouting,"If you don ’ t like the circus , blame the ringmaster . <EOS> <EOP> Mayor de Blasio ripped the organizers of Tuesday ’ s mayoral debate , saying the presence of an audience of “ partisans ” allowed it to descend into chaos . <EOS> <EOP> “ It was not what the people of New York City deserved . <EOS> It was not structured to be the kind of conversation it should have been , ” de Blasio said . <EOS> “ We have serious issues we ’ re dealing with . <EOS> It should have been a thoughtful format that allowed for real discussion of the issues , and it was a lost opportunity . ” <EOS> <EOP> The Russians have also confirmed that their EW systems are present in Syria and have been used operationally there . <EOS> This should not however be taken as any sort of confirmation that they were used to jam the Tomahawk missiles that the US launched against Al-Shayrat air base . <EOS> <EOP> Confirmation that Russian EW systems have been used operationally in Syria was made a month ago , on 17th March 2017 , well before the US missile strike on Al-Sharyat air base , by Igor Nasenkov , who is the deputy CEO of Russia ’ s Radio-electronic Technologies Group ( KRET ) , which is an affiliate of Russia ’ s giant state owned electronics company Rostec <EOS> <EOP> As a matter of fact it is know that Russia has deployed the very advanced Krasukha-S4 EW system to Syria ( see below ) , and presumably Nasenkov ’ s comments refer in part to this system . <EOS> <EOP> As with the details of the Zircon test , details of Russia ’ s current EW systems have been provided in a lengthy article carried by TASS , the Russian government ’ s official news agency . <EOS> TASS has in fact provided a veritable smörgåsbord of information about various Russian EW systems , though the true extent of their capabilities remains of course classified . <EOS> They are as follows : <EOS> <EOP> ( 1 ) Vitebsk System – carried by SU-25 ground attack aircraft , MI-28 and KA-52 helicopter gunships , and MI-26 heavy lift helicopters amongst others , intended to protect aircraft from surface to air missiles . <EOS> This system is known to be routinely used by these aircraft operating in Syria . <EOS> <EOP> ( 2 ) Rychag-AV – apparently a new system operated by a specialised EW version of the evergreen MI-8 transport helicopter . <EOS> TASS says this about it <EOS> <EOP> The debate , which included Republican Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis and independent candidate Bo Dietl , was marred by shouting from supporters of all three candidates , who made up the bulk of the crowd . <EOS> ( There was also plenty of shouting from Dietl , who had his microphone cut off by exasperated moderator Errol Louis at one point . ) <EOS> <EOP> Malliotakis pleased with mayoral debate , but better without Dietl <EOS> <EOP> Hizzoner pointed fingers at the organizers . <EOS> The debate was hosted by NY1 , with panelists from Politico and WNYC . <EOS> It was sanctioned by the Campaign Finance Board , which sets eligibility thresholds and requires candidates using public matching funds to debate . <EOS> <EOP> “ With all due respect to the people who put together the debate , they didn ’ t put it together the right way , ” the mayor fumed . <EOS> “ If you invite a big crowd of partisans , you either have to create ground rules to really ensure that they keep respectful , or don ’ t invite a big crowd of partisans or have it in a studio . <EOS> They didn ’ t do it right , period . ” <EOS> <EOP> He said he ’ d attended the primary debate in Brooklyn between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders , where the crowd was warned not to make noise after an initial round of applause — and he said it worked . <EOS> <EOP> “ This wasn ’ t that and it was done the wrong way and it was a disservice to the people of New York City , ” he said . <EOS> <EOP> A spokeswoman for Charter — the New York wing of Spectrum , NY1 ’ s parent company — said the company had no comment on the mayor ’ s remarks . <EOS> <EOP> Before the debate began , Louis did warn the crowd — who he acknowledged were supporters of the candidates — not to act out during the debate . <EOS> But the crowd ignored that warning , prompting Louis to ask them to take a lesson from former Mayor David Dinkins ’ dignity halfway through the debate , and to eventually have police remove a man who shouted out that the mayor would go to jail . <EOS> ",1

Province Of Ontario To Make It Easier For People To Kill Themselves,"The Canadian province of Ontario wants to make assisted suicide easier for people . <EOS> Soon , people wanting to kill themselves will be able to seek direct assistance to do so instead of consulting with health care providers who might find the request morally objectionable . <EOS> Ontario Health Minister Eric Hoskins says he ’ ll have a “ care co-ordination service ” ready for operation as early as May . <EOS> The service will enable patients to find “ health-care providers ” who don ’ t object to helping the patients kill themselves . <EOS> “ That patient , or their family members or their caregiver , would have the ability to be in contact with the care-co-ordination service directly , ” Hoskins said . <EOS> “ They would then , through that process , that phone call or email , be linked into all of what ’ s required . <EOS> If they chose medical assistance in dying , they would be able to follow that through to completion. ” Assisted suicide has only been legal in Canada for less than a year but the “ medical service ” has proven popular in Ontario , where 365 people have opted for the procedure between June 2016 and the end of March 2017 . <EOS> Ontario , with a left-of-center Liberal government that already promotes graphic sex education for early elementary school , has been actively engaged in making the procedure easier to use . <EOS> As soon as assisted death was legalized , the Ontario ministry of health established a help-line for doctors seeking other doctors who were willing to end their patients ’ s lives . <EOS> Much as they are forced to do if asked to perform an abortion against their wishes , Ontario law forces doctors to refer their patients to another physician to do whatever procedure the patient ’ s regular doctor refuses to do . <EOS> <EOP> That hasn ’ t stopped some physicians who object to assisted suicide because of moral or religious convictions from refusing to make those calls — or at least telling the government that they object being put into what they consider the morally untenable situation of enabling a person to kill themselves . <EOS> <EOP> The advocacy group Dying with Dignity has been actively monitoring instances where doctors inhibit somebody ’ s determination to seek assisted suicide . <EOS> It has relayed these cases to the provincial health minister and Hoskins says that is precisely why he has authorized the new “ care co-ordination service ” so patients can avoid the obdurate doctors who stand in their way of death . <EOS> <EOP> But that won ’ t be enough for Dying With Dignity CEO Shanaaz Gokool who allows that the new service is an “ improvement ” but wants the province to go further and just insist that faith-based organizations not be allowed to decline requests to assist in a suicide . <EOS> That would mean repealing a section of the assisted suicide legislation that allows them to opt-out . <EOS> But Gokool doesn ’ t think that ’ s much of an infringement on freedom of religion . <EOS> She says it ’ s inconvenient to expect people in religious hospitals to have to transfer to another medical facility just to find a doctor who will help them commit suicide . <EOS> <EOP> Putin said Russia will request that the United Nations investigate the April 4 chemical weapons attack in the Syrian town of Khan Shaykhun . <EOS> He added that he has received information about planned `` provocations '' intended to place blame on Assad . <EOS> <EOP> “ If you ’ re in a facility and they ’ re refusing to assess you , and refusing to help you , and you can ’ t help yourself , who ’ s going to do that for you ? ” she said . <EOS> ",1

Polish MP Schools BBC Host On Refugees : ‘ How Many Terror Attacks Have You Had In London ? ’,"He said that after recognizing it as a veteran ’ s funeral procession , he did not think twice about his next move . <EOS> Without even knowing whose funeral was driving by , Varnes honored his fellow vet . <EOS> <EOP> “ This is probably going to make someone ’ s day , seeing me stand here , and I know how it is to go through a tough time like that , and I really just did it just to make someone ’ s day , that was it , ” Varnes told the reporter . <EOS> <EOP> Polish MP Dominik Tarczynski of the ruling Law and Justice Party schooled a BBC host on the threat of refugees and turned her into a bumbling fool . <EOS> <EOP> In an interview posted to YouTube on Thursday , Tarczynski is asked by a BBC host why Poland is not honoring their agreement to take in refugees . <EOS> <EOP> “ Well , basically because people who voted for us they said no , ” Tarczynski stated matter-of-factly . <EOS> “ The previous government had this agreement and now Polish people said no , we don ’ t want to have this threat in Poland … and we have to respect them . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ We have to remember that this agreement was signed by the previous government and now the situation in Poland is completely changed , ” he said . <EOS> “ We have to listen to our people . ” <EOS> <EOP> The BBC host countered : “ Except , if you look at it from the other side , this agreement was made by Poland not by internal Polish politics . <EOS> You can see you can see how that is being seen from outside . <EOS> People will say , well look , we don ’ t care about bickering inside Polish politics . <EOS> The country has agreed to take its fair share of asylum seekers and that ’ s not happening . ” <EOS> <EOP> Another Facebook user , Teresita Rey posted , “ Please keep sharing this . <EOS> Let ’ s make it go viral ! <EOS> This is what respect looks like . <EOS> I am a proud cousin right now . <EOS> No one asked Kenneth to do this . <EOS> He just got out and ignored the rain to focus on thanking a soldier for protecting this country . <EOS> We need to see more actions like this on a daily basis . <EOS> ♡ ” <EOS> <EOP> “ It ’ s not not about internal politics , ” Tarczynski said , “ it ’ s about the situation in Poland , in Europe , in the world . <EOS> How many terror attacks you had in London ? ” <EOS> <EOP> His step-mother , Ashley Jacobs wrote , “ My step son has gone viral . <EOS> Not for attention or recognition but for respect to a soldier and his family . <EOS> I love you son ! <EOS> I ’ m proud of the man you ’ ve become . ” <EOS> <EOP> Tarczynski went on to say : “ I ’ m a lawyer , they are not refugees they are immigrants . <EOS> There is a legal difference between refugee and immigrant . <EOS> Refugee is the person who flees to the first safe country , not flying throughout the globe looking for the social and better life , so we are not talking about refugees . ” <EOS> <EOP> The whiny BBC host interrupted Tarczynski constantly throughout the interview to try and prevent him from making his points but ended up failing miserably . <EOS> Listen to the full interview above . <EOS> ",1
Europe Could See Rupture -- Beyond Spain ...,"Some of the great moments of history sneak up on businesspeople . <EOS> Two years ago , Britain looked to be Europe ’ s most economically rational country ; now its companies seem to be rolling from one economic earthquake to another , with Brexit looking increasingly likely to be followed by the election of a near-Marxist prime minister , Jeremy Corbyn . <EOS> <EOP> Looking back , two things stand out . <EOS> First , there were some deep underlying “ irrational ” causes that business ignored , such as the pent-up anger against immigration and globalization . <EOS> Second , there was a string of short-term political decisions that proved to be miscalculations . <EOS> For decades , for example , attacking the European Union was a “ free hit ” for British politicians . <EOS> If David Cameron had it to do over again , would he really have made the referendum on whether to stay in it a simple majority vote ( or indeed called a vote at all ) ? <EOS> Does Angela Merkel now regret giving Cameron so few concessions before the Brexit vote ? <EOS> Would the moderate Labour members of Parliament who helped Corbyn get on their party ’ s leadership ballot in the name of political diversity really do that again ? <EOS> <EOP> Now , another rupture may be sneaking up on Europe , driven by a similar mixture of pent-up anger and short-term political maneuvering . <EOS> This one is between the old West European democratic core of the EU , led by Merkel and increasingly by Emmanuel Macron , who are keen to integrate the euro zone , and the populist authoritarians of Eastern Europe , who dislike Brussels . <EOS> This time the arguments are ones about political freedom and national sovereignty . <EOS> <EOP> Later this month it looks likely the Czechs will have a new Trumpian prime minister—Andrej Babis , a populist billionaire who wants to send Arab immigrants back home and promises to make the government work as well as his businesses do . <EOS> To be fair to Babis , he ’ s a rather more subtle figure than the American president ( not to mention a more successful businessman ) . <EOS> He is , for instance , careful to emphasize his respect for the judiciary and , on immigration , he welcomes newcomers from Ukraine , pointing out that he himself comes from Slovakia . <EOS> His main appeal is efficiency ( he fumes about his former coalition partners playing with their phones in cabinet meetings ) . <EOS> <EOP> However , Babis is plainly opposed to increased European integration of the sort that Macron wants and is also against Brussels meddling in Eastern Europe . <EOS> That means that , whatever the subtleties of Babis ’ s relatively centrist brand of populism , he is likely to be bundled in with Viktor Orban of Hungary and Jaroslaw Kaczynski of Poland as part of Europe ’ s authoritarian fringe . <EOS> <EOP> Kaczynski is not the formal leader of Poland , but he runs the right-wing Law & Justice Party that holds both the presidency and the premiership ( which he ’ s delegated to others ) . <EOS> A fierce critic of Merkel , especially on immigration , he ’ s at almost permanent war with the EU , with his battles ranging from institutional—after Brexit , he called for powers to be returned from Brussels—to the personal—he tried ( unsuccessfully ) to stop his more conciliatory fellow Pole , Donald Tusk , from becoming president of the European Council . <EOS> For the EU ’ s part , Frans Timmermans , a European Commission vice president , is formally investigating Law & Justice ’ s judicial “ reforms , ” which look like an attempt to clear out any unsympathetic judges , and its interference in the press . <EOS> At its worst , this could mean triggering Article 7 , which would suspend Poland ’ s voting rights on the European Council . <EOS> <EOP> Kaczynski once boasted that he would make Warsaw into Budapest . <EOS> That reflects how Hungary ’ s Orban has led the way . <EOS> A far more diplomatic figure than Kaczynski , Orban , who once was an anti-Soviet firebrand , also stands accused of reining in the judiciary and besmirching his opponents ( including the EU ) : His government is currently circulating a publicly funded “ national consultation , ” a piece of cartoon propaganda about what it calls the “ Soros plan , ” whereby the EU would implement a dastardly scheme of Hungarian-born financier George Soros to dismantle Hungary ’ s anti-migrant border fences and pay migrants to come to Europe . <EOS> But Orban has generally been smarter than his Polish disciple about retreating before the EU takes any action . <EOS> Despite opposition posters depicting him and his business friends as gangsters , Orban is expected to easily win Hungary ’ s elections next year . <EOS> <EOP> This brings home the basic fact about all three populists : They ’ re popular . <EOS> Businesspeople in the region tend to shrug off the chances of schism with the EU . <EOS> Their economies are doing well , they point out . <EOS> Yes , few Eastern Europeans are keen to have Syrian refugees as neighbors , but that is also true in France and Germany ( revealingly , in September ’ s German election , it was the eastern regions that voted most fervently for the anti-EU party , the AfD ) . <EOS> Businesspeople tend to stress that Orban and Babis are pragmatists , that they will stop before they go too far . <EOS> Business is also confident that Germany in particular will not want to sever relations with an area that is now so completely integrated with its own economy . <EOS> <EOP> Babis , the most businesslike of the three leaders , backs this view . <EOS> He fears that if there were a referendum tomorrow , Czechs would vote to leave , but that is precisely why he would not consider holding one . <EOS> It would be mad for a country of the Czech Republic ’ s size to even think of leaving the union . <EOS> <EOP> The business view seems logical enough . <EOS> But it ’ s also a little like the pre-Brexit presumption of British business : In the end , the common man ( and woman ) would listen to the voices of economic reason and choose to remain . <EOS> The problem was that British voters didn ’ t think that way . <EOS> After decades of being told how useless the EU was—especially on migration—millions of angry Britons voted to leave . <EOS> Meanwhile , many of the EU ’ s leaders , having put up with British opposition for a long time , said good riddance . <EOS> <EOP> In Eastern Europe , one reason the odds are still against a schism is that the Poles , Czechs , and Hungarians have the ever more disastrous case study of Brexit to look at . <EOS> Meanwhile , Western Europe ’ s leaders are not in a rush to lose more members . <EOS> But there is also the chance of short-term politicking getting in the way—of action creating reaction . <EOS> <EOP> In this case , two personalities are likely to play outsize roles . <EOS> One is the new French president . <EOS> On the campaign trail , Macron complained about people turning a blind eye to Poland and Hungary—and said he would seek sanctions on Poland for infringing EU rules and values while benefiting economically from membership . <EOS> There is principle behind this : The EU was supposed to usher countries toward democracy and , especially in the Trumpian world , sees itself as a defender of human rights . <EOS> But politics also plays a role : Few French voters would shed tears if less money went to Hungary and it was harder for Polish plumbers to get jobs in Paris . <EOS> And now Macron wants to push ahead with efforts to integrate the EU , centering on the euro zone , which will enrage the eastern countries that are outside the currency union . <EOS> <EOP> The other personality is Kaczynski . <EOS> Volatile , paranoid ( he recently accused his “ scumbag ” political opponents of “ murdering ” his brother ) , and obsessed by his country ’ s tragic history , the Polish leader makes Boris Johnson seem rather predictable and easy to handle . <EOS> Like Orban and Babis , he ’ s fiercely opposed to any idea of increasing powers in Brussels or increasing the gap that separates the inner core of euro-currency countries . <EOS> But he ’ s much worse at cutting deals with Europe . <EOS> <EOP> What would happen if the EU imposed more

Ivanka accused of using her dad 's presidency to profit,"Sales of Ivanka Trump 's merchandise enjoyed a massive increase in sales after Kellyanne Conway hawked it from the White House on national TV , new statistics show . <EOS> <EOP> The stats , which come from online marketplace Lyst , show sales for February 9 - the day Conway promoted the items - up by 10,700 per cent on the same date the previous year . <EOS> <EOP> The new information comes on the same day that it emerged that Ivanka was given three trademarks in China , where sales of her products have skyrocketed , the same day that she met the Chinese president . <EOS> <EOP> That has inevitably lead to complaints that she is exploiting her position to benefit her business . <EOS> <EOP> The push Conway gave Ivanka 's goods in February was huge - particularly in red states , a Lyst spokesperson said - but short-lived . <EOS> <EOP> February 10 was almost as high as the day before , with an increase of 9,700 per cent on the 2016 date . <EOS> The brand went from 550th most popular to 11th for that month . <EOS> <EOP> Sales dropped rapidly after that , but the increase was enough to leave the monthly average 771 percent up on February 2016 . <EOS> <EOP> And although several stores have dropped her goods after the # GrabYourWallet online campaign tried to render the brands toxic , her business has recorded its best-ever year . <EOS> <EOP> A good part of that is thanks to a massive increase in sales in China for the brand , which Ivanka no longer manages , but still owns . <EOS> <EOP> That 's why eyebrows were raised when it emerged Tuesday that her company was granted three provisional trademarks on April 6 . <EOS> <EOP> That 's the same day she dined with Chinese president Xi Jinping at her father 's Mar-a-Lago resort . <EOS> <EOP> Those trademarks grant the company monopoly rights to sell Ivanka-brand jewelry , bags and spa services in the world 's second-largest economy . <EOS> <EOP> Abigail Klem , who took over as president from Ivanka , said there was nothing unusual about the applications . <EOS> <EOP> 'We have recently seen a surge in trademark filings by unrelated third parties trying to capitalize on the name and it is our responsibility to diligently protect our trademark , ' she said . <EOS> <EOP> And Ivanka 's lawyer says that she does not 'weigh in on business strategy , marketing issues or the commercial terms of agreements ' - and reserves the right to cancel agreements that create , or appear to create , a conflict of interest . <EOS> <EOP> But as her company grows in scope , critics are saying it diminishes her ability to give credible counsel to Trump on core issues like trade , intellectual property and the value of Chinese currency . <EOS> <EOP> That means critics are lining up to tell her to back off . <EOS> <EOP> 'Put the business on hold and stop trying to get trademarks while you 're in government , ' said Richard Painter , who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under George W Bush . <EOS> <EOP> 'Ivanka has so many China ties and conflicts , yet she and Jared appear deeply involved in China contacts and policy , ' said Norman Eisen , who was Barack Obama 's chief White House ethics lawyer . <EOS> <EOP> ' I would never have allowed it . <EOS> For their own sake , and the country 's , Ivanka and Jared should consider stepping away from China matters .

Trump could stay in Paris deal ‘ under the right conditions ’ : Tillerson,"WASHINGTON – President Trump could stay in the Paris climate accord if certain “ conditions ” are met , according to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson . <EOS> <EOP> “ I think under the right conditions , ” Tillerson told CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” Sunday on the chance of the US staying in the agreement . <EOS> “ The president said he ’ s open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue . ” <EOS> <EOP> Trump pledged on June 1 that the US would withdraw from the agreement because it hinders American businesses and he would seek a better deal . <EOS> <EOP> The withdrawal from the 2015 agreement was panned by environmentalists and the US ’ international partners , but Trump won praise from his base on following through with a campaign pledge . <EOS> <EOP> But in the months since , White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has led an effort to find ways to stay in the global agreement and keep the US at the table , the Wall Street Journal reported last week . <EOS> <EOP> White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters initially pushed back at the notion of reversal saying there ’ s been “ no change ” to Trump ’ s decision . <EOS> <EOP> But Tillerson explained on Sunday the US is trying to stay engaged . <EOS> <EOP> “ So I think the plan is for Director Cohn to consider other ways in which we can work with partners in the Paris climate a ccord , ” Tillerson said . <EOS> “ We want to be productive . <EOS> We want to be helpful . ” <EOS> <EOP> National Security Adviser H.R . <EOS> McMaster also said on ABC ’ s “ This Week ” that the US might stay in the Paris deal under some changes . <EOS> <EOP> “ He left the door open to reentering at some later time if there can be a better deal for the United States , ” McMaster said of Trump . <EOS> “ … If there ’ s an agreement that benefits the American people , certainly . ” <EOS> ",0
Michael Moore Reveals Plans Libs Have to Take Your Guns,"Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore , a veritable leftist wacko notorious for his inane ideas , has unveiled his dumbest idea yet , proposing on Facebook last week that the United States repeal the “ ancient and outdated ” Second Amendment . <EOS> <EOP> “ I , Michael Moore , along with all who support an end to this epidemic of gun violence , propose a new Amendment to our Constitution that repeals the ancient and outdated 2nd Amendment … and replaces it with a new 28th Amendment , ” he wrote in a Facebook post last Wednesday . <EOS> <EOP> According to Moore , his fancy new amendment would allow “ individuals to use guns for sport and gathering food , ” and guarantee “ everyone the right to be free of , and protected from , gun violence . ” <EOS> <EOP> Unless he owns a literal magic wand , there ’ s no way on earth for him to stop all gun violence . <EOS> But let ’ s go ahead and humor him anyway and read what he has to say . <EOS> <EOP> “ As over 90 % of gun violence is committed by men , in order for a man to purchase a gun , he must first get a waiver from his current wife , plus his most recent ex-wife , or any woman with whom he is currently in a relationship , ” he wrote , adding that gay men would have to obtain a waiver from their partner . <EOS> <EOP> That ’ s patently sexist — not to mention absurd to the max — but OK . <EOS> <EOP> North Korea just threatened to sink a U.S. carrier in order to show how strong its military is . <EOS> Two Japanese ships joined a U.S. strike group in the Philippine Sea . <EOS> <EOP> “ Our revolutionary forces are combat-ready to sink a U.S. nuclear powered aircraft carrier with a single strike , ” according to North Korea ’ s ruling Workers ’ Party ’ s newspaper . <EOS> <EOP> The paper then called the USS Car Vinson a “ gross animal ” and said that striking the carrier would be “ an actual example to show our military ’ s force . ” <EOS> <EOP> He said North Korea has to conform : <EOS> <EOP> According to Fox News , analysts think that North Korea is gearing up for a sixth nuclear test . <EOS> North Korea is working to make nuclear-tipped missiles that ’ ll reach the U.S. coastline . <EOS> <EOP> Apparently , he also wants to ban all “ automatic ” and “ semi-automatic ” weapons ( though he likely has no clue what those terms actually mean ) , install fingerprint sensors on every gun and force firearm owners to store their weapons “ at a licensed gun club or government-regulated gun storage facility . ” <EOS> <EOP> Wow . <EOS> Every time I think his proposal can ’ t get any dumber , he proves me wrong yet again . <EOS> And hilariously enough , Moore ended his asinine post with a threat : “ Let every candidate know : If you take NRA money , we will remove you from office . ” <EOS> <EOP> Said the guy whose entire party was eviscerated during the last election . <EOS> Come on , Moore , who are you kidding ? <EOS> Conservatives control the White House , the House , the Senate and most state legislatures because of radical dingbats like you who ’ ve driven sensible Americans away from the Democrat Party . <EOS> <EOP> So please , on behalf of my fellow Republicans , keep spouting off idiotic ideas like this , all while you use your Hollywood wealth to travel the nation with as many as up to nine bodyguards who probably carry guns , you hypocritical clown . <EOS> <EOP> Please share this story on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about Michael Moore ’ s hilarious delusions of grandeur . <EOS> ",1

Wall Street Journal Editorial Board Explodes at Trump ’ s ‘ America First ’ Immigration Proposals,"One parent , Elizabeth Vaillencourt , complained about the alteration of historical documents . <EOS> The Washington Times writes that “ the school reacted by putting her child in a different class. ” – READ MORE <EOS> <EOP> “ Does President Trump want a bipartisan deal on immigration , or is his talk merely for cable-TV show ? ” the outlet , which caters to a big business readership , wrote . <EOS> <EOP> Trump ’ s proposal , believed to have been drafted by nationalist adviser Stephen Miller , would shield illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children and eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program in return for a host of measures demanded by conservatives . <EOS> Those include funding for the wall on the southern border , mandated use of E-Verify by employers , an increase in immigration agents , greater restrictions on which family members immigrants can bring , and a stripping of funds from so-called “ sanctuary cities . ” <EOS> <EOP> Trump had cozied up to the Democrats shortly after announcing the repeal of the Obama-era DACA program in September — setting a six-month time limit for its expiration and urging Congress to make a deal . <EOS> Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-NY ) indicated that Trump had suggested funding for the wall had been jettisoned by Trump as a firm term , replaced instead by a vague “ border security. ” But the proposals announced late Sunday indicate a return to Trump ’ s “ America First ” campaign stance that helped him win the election in 2016 . <EOS> <EOP> However , the Journal described the demands as “ everything that the restrictionist right has ever sought ” and making an agreement “ well-nigh impossible . ” <EOS> <EOP> The article pivots to its concern for cheap labor for big business , claiming that “ tight visa caps ” are sending high-tech jobs abroad and agricultural production to Mexico . <EOS> Oddly , it claims that limiting chain migration for family members would encourage more illegal immigration — the argument apparently being that America should just let in potential illegal immigrants before they break the law . <EOS> <EOP> As Breitbart News reported , this argument from the center-right outfit is in line with that being pushed by a number of left-wing media and advocacy groups claiming that such demands are “ poison pills ” because they will upset Democrats . <EOS> <EOP> “ It ’ s hard to know if Mr. Trump intends all this as a serious negotiating offer , or merely as poison pills , ” the editorial board writes . <EOS> The case for the latter is that he is demanding money for the wall , which he knows is a nonstarter with Democrats . ” <EOS> <EOP> The board essentially is arguing that Trump should give up on a central campaign promise because Democrats do not like it . <EOS> However , it later says that he would be much better off going for the old talking point of a “ virtual wall ” : <EOS> <EOP> If such a wall is a real possibility and would actually work better than a real wall , it is unclear why the Journal thinks Democrats would fund this , either . <EOS> <EOP> But after claiming for much of the article that Democrats would scupper the deal , the board admits that such demands would “ have no chance of passing no matter which party controls Congress ” — essentially conceding that the problem is not just the Democrats . <EOS> <EOP> It finishes with the warning that if illegal immigrants are not granted amnesty via a DACA replacement , Democrats will “ blame ” Republicans for their deportation — despite this being a campaign promise from the president . <EOS> <EOP> “ This would be a humanitarian calamity , and a monumental lost political opportunity . <EOS> Mr. Trump needs legislative victories to show he can govern , but his immigration bait and switch may guarantee another failure . ” <EOS> <EOP> The WSJ article is the latest in a broad attack from pro-big business interests . <EOS> Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ’ s lobbying group has reportedly been lobbying top Republicans to prevent President Trump from including pro-American reforms as part of the amnesty for DACA recipients . <EOS> <EOP> Adam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York . <EOS> Follow Adam on Twitter : @ AdamShawNY . <EOS> <EOP> We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all [ humans ] are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . <EOS> That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among [ humans ] , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed… <EOS> ",1
"Antifa thugs deface , try toppling what they take for Confederate statue—except it ’ s a Peace Monument","Antifa — the left-wing band of mask-wearing thugs whose calling card is beating up and tossing urine and feces at detractors — has struck again . <EOS> <EOP> Black-clad members of the militant group , their faces hidden by bandanas , climbed atop an Atlanta statue Sunday night — right on the heels of deadly demonstrations in Charlottesville , Virginia — proceeded to spray it with red paint and then attempted to tear it down using a chain . <EOS> <EOP> Antifa apparently took the statue in Piedmont Park for a Confederate memorial , several of which have come down on the heels of Charlottesville violence over a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue there . <EOS> <EOP> Except the statue that Antifa members were trying to topple isn ’ t a Confederate statue . <EOS> <EOP> Featuring an angel standing above a Confederate soldier , urging him to lay down his weapon , the sculpture is known as Peace Monument . <EOS> <EOP> Still several protesters chanted , “ Tear it down . <EOS> Tear it down , ” WXIA-TV reported , adding that many in the crowd dispersed seeing the statue being defaced , apparently wanting no part of property destruction . <EOS> <EOP> Atlanta author Goldie Taylor reminded folks on social media Sunday night what the statue stands for : <EOS> <EOP> But just as the fun was revving into a higher gear , Atlanta Police Maj. Timothy Peek arrived and stood in front of the monument , police told WXIA , adding that demonstrators at that moment released the chain . <EOS> <EOP> Peek then spoke to the crowd and persuaded them to do no further damage to the statue , police told the station in a statement . <EOS> <EOP> Antifa protesters nevertheless surrounded Peek and shouted “ pig , ” the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported . <EOS> But Black Lives Matter protesters put themselves between the officer and the Antifa members , which seemed to quell tensions , the paper said . <EOS> <EOP> A protester was hurt by metal falling from the structure during the attempted tearing down , the paper added . <EOS> <EOP> The statue was commissioned in 1911 to symbolize efforts of reconciliation between the North and South after the Civil War . <EOS> According to the state of Georgia , the monument was funded by the Old Guard Battalion of the Gate City Guard , which traces it heritage to 1854 when a group of private citizens formed a private militia to help the city keep law and order . <EOS> <EOP> Police said in its Monday statement that they weren ’ t able to identify the culprits , who would face charges of criminal trespass , criminal damage to property or destruction of property . <EOS> <EOP> Oh , and the olive branch the angel was holding ? <EOS> WXIA reported that it ’ s now broken . <EOS> <EOP> One man told WXIA that what happened to the Peace Monument is symbolic of what ’ s happening around the country — that while it represents peace , “ it doesn ’ t seem like people want peace , like people are really against that . ” <EOS> ",0

What 's in Trump 's tax reform plan to be released this week ?,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump plans to stick with his campaign pledge to slash the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent , but the dramatic cut raises a problematic question for the White House : How can the president deliver the “ massive ” tax cut he promised without also blowing a massive hole in the budget ? <EOS> <EOP> A senior administration official confirmed the planned reduction to corporate rates , speaking on condition of anonymity in order discuss details of the plan the president is expected to unveil Wednesday . <EOS> <EOP> Most outside economic analyses say the type of tax cuts being promoted by Trump would likely fuel even larger deficits for a federal government already projected to see its debt steadily rise . <EOS> The lowered tax rates are also unlikely to generate Trump ’ s ambitious promised growth rate of 3 percent a year , roughly double the 1.6 percent growth achieved last year . <EOS> These two factors are related because the Trump administration is counting on faster economic growth to produce additional tax revenues that could then close the deficit . <EOS> The concept was popularized as “ trickle-down ” economics during the Reagan years . <EOS> <EOP> The problem is that the economy can ’ t grow quickly enough to cover the likely hole in the deficit . <EOS> <EOP> “ There ’ s no pure tax cut that pays for itself , ” said Alan Cole , an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation . <EOS> <EOP> Trump has promised to release the outlines of his tax plan Wednesday and has said the plan would give Americans a tax cut bigger than “ any tax cut ever. ” During the campaign , he backed cutting the corporate tax rate - and the personal income tax rate to 33 percent from a top marginal rate of 39.6 percent . <EOS> <EOP> Although he did not disclose details , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday the lower tax rates would generate so much economic growth that it would hold the deficit in check . <EOS> <EOP> “ The tax reform will pay for itself with economic growth , ” Mnuchin said at the White House news briefing , adding that the overhaul would ideally let someone file taxes on a “ large postcard . ” <EOS> <EOP> By running the risk of higher deficits , the Trump plan could damage the credibility of Republican lawmakers who spent years railing against the rising national debt under former President Barack Obama . <EOS> Trump could also make it harder to pass lasting tax reform , since any policy that increases the debt above its baseline either requires Democratic support or - if passed by a slim majority of Republicans in the Senate - would expire in a decade . <EOS> The House Republican tax blueprint tried to offset the lower rates by introducing a new tax system that applies to imports . <EOS> <EOP> Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn are scheduled to meet with congressional leaders Tuesday evening to talk about the president ’ s tax plan . <EOS> They are expected to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady , R-Texas . <EOS> <EOP> Warren Buffett said Tuesday he is very concerned over the threat from nuclear weapons . <EOS> <EOP> Hatch and Brady will be key players in Congress as lawmakers try to tackle a tax overhaul . <EOS> <EOP> Trump ’ s announcement Friday that he would unveil a tax plan this week caught lawmakers by surprise , despite regular conversations among Mnuchin , Cohn and congressional leaders , said a congressional aide . <EOS> The aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity , was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue . <EOS> <EOP> Without a proposal on the table , the White House has been vague about the president ’ s support for ideas circulating in Congress . <EOS> <EOP> It ’ s unclear whether the president favors the House Republican blueprint ’ s border adjustment tax system , which would lower corporate rates to 20 percent by essentially taxing imports and excluding U.S. exports . <EOS> <EOP> Trump told Fox Business News that he prefers a “ reciprocal ” tax in which any tariffs , duties or taxes would match what trading partners charge . <EOS> <EOP> Most economists say it ’ s unlikely that tax cuts can generate enough gains to avoid swelling the government ’ s red-ink problem -

"Breitbart pretends to oppose racism , fires writer who posted string of bigoted tweets","Katie McHugh has lost her job as a writer for Breitbart after posting a blatantly Islamophobic tweet about the London attack on Saturday evening . <EOS> <EOP> McHugh ’ s tweet promoted Iranian-American actor Pej Vahdat to tell her , “ You ’ re a real moron. ” In a since-deleted reply , McHugh said , incorrectly , “ You ’ re an Indian . ” <EOS> <EOP> On Sunday , CNN reported that employees at Breitbart — which has a well-deserved reputation for promoting Islamophobia , sexism , and white nationalism — variously found McHugh ’ s tweets to be “ appalling , “ terrible , ” and “ dumb . ” <EOS> <EOP> But as CNN reported , in since-deleted tweets , another Breitbart writer named Ryan Saavedra defended McHugh , writing , “ People think I ’ m kidding when I say this but the crusades need to come back… This shit won ’ t stop until people grow a pair of balls . ” <EOS> <EOP> Breitbart management , however , decided McHugh went too far and decided to part ways with her . <EOS> <EOP> McHugh announced her firing on Twitter on Monday afternoon . <EOS> <EOP> Her tweet linked to a fundraising page that claims McHugh “ was fired on June 5 for telling the truth about Islam and immigration in Europe . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ Instead of giving her a raise , Breitbart squealed at pressure from leftist CNN , which apparently has anonymous pro-Islam sources at Breitbart , and fired her , ” the fundraising page says . <EOS> “ Why is Breitbart silencing Katie McHugh for telling the truth about Islam ? … Katie McHugh has essential medical bills that she has to pay , while finding another job . <EOS> Support Katie and send a message to Breitbart , the liberal media , and apologists for Islamic terrorism . ” <EOS> <EOP> The fundraising page also contains the following statement from McHugh . <EOS> <EOP> Saturday ’ s tweets were far from the first time McHugh posted offensive comments on Twitter . <EOS> <EOP> Though her tweets are obviously reprehensible , McHugh has good reason to be confused about Breitbart ’ s decision to fire her . <EOS> The site used to be run by Trump adviser Steve Bannon , who described it as “ the platform for the alt-right ” — a euphemism popularized by Richard Spencer , head of the white supremacist National Policy Institute ( NPI ) , one of the country ’ s leading contemporary advocates of ideological racism . <EOS> <EOP> Under Bannon ’ s watch , Breitbart published articles with headlines like , “ The solution to online ‘ harassment ’ is simple : Women should log off , ” “ Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy , ” “ Hoist it high and proud : The Confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage , ” and “ There ’ s no hiring bias against women in tech , they just suck at interviews . ” <EOS> <EOP> The site also regularly gave some of the world ’ s most notorious Islamophobes a platform to publish pieces like , “ Stopping Islamic Immigration Is a Matter or Survival ” and “ How Many Fort Hood-Style Jihad Attacks Must There Be ? ” Shortly before Trump ’ s inauguration , the site came under fire for running a fake news story about a Muslim mob setting fire to a church in Germany . <EOS> <EOP> As this is published , Breitbart still features a “ BLACK CRIME ” section . <EOS> And yet , in Trump ’ s America , the site has become more mainstream than ever . <EOS> In April , a Breitbart piece was shared by the Twitter account of the branch of the Department of Defense responsible for the nuclear arsenal . <EOS> <EOP> As McHugh alludes to in her statement , her Islamophobic rhetoric draws inspiration from President Trump , who used the London attack to again agitate for his Muslim ban . <EOS> In the wake of the attack in London , Trump decided to use Twitter to repeatedly smear London ’ s Muslim mayor and tweeted about the need to “ stop being politically correct . ” <EOS> ",0
The Senate health bill takes what Americans hate about Obamacare and makes it worse,"The Senate GOP ’ s health care bill is a strange document . <EOS> It doesn ’ t fix what conservatives dislike most about Obamacare . <EOS> But it takes what everyone else hates about Obamacare and makes it much , much worse . <EOS> <EOP> The plan keeps Obamacare ’ s basic structure intact . <EOS> The tax credits remain tied to income . <EOS> Many of the insurance regulations remain in place . <EOS> Medicaid is , in theory , gutted down the road , but the cuts don ’ t even begin until 2021 — raising the fear for conservatives that they ’ ll never happen at all . <EOS> Even the cost-sharing reductions to insurers — which Republicans bemoaned as an illegal “ bailout ” — are restored . <EOS> <EOP> So Obamacare — the government program that makes it the state ’ s responsibility to cover people with health insurance — mostly survives . <EOS> If you are a conservative angry that the federal government has created a new health care entitlement , this bill doesn ’ t solve your problem . <EOS> <EOP> But under the Senate bill , Obamacare ’ s ability to actually cover people with health insurance is sharply diminished . <EOS> Because the plan shifts hundreds of billions of dollars in insurance subsidies to tax cuts for the wealthy , there ’ s not enough money in it to cover nearly as many people , with nearly as good insurance , as there is now . <EOS> <EOP> So Obamacare — the program that got more than 20 million people onto ( usually ) decent health insurance — is gutted . <EOS> If you are a liberal who supports the Affordable Care Act because it improves people ’ s lives , this bill will infuriate you . <EOS> <EOP> The new world created by the Senate health care bill will be based around higher-deductible plans that cover fewer health benefits and cost people more . <EOS> The plan degrades Obamacare ’ s insurance regulations , and cuts insurance subsidies so that Americans won ’ t be able to afford plans as generous as the ones they purchase now . <EOS> If the Medicaid expansion really does die out in 2024 , then the poorest of the poor will be pushed from comprehensive , low-cost health insurance to extremely high-deductible plans . <EOS> <EOP> So if you , like most Americans , think Obamacare does some good , but it doesn ’ t cover enough people , and the people it does cover are paying too much to get too little , you are going to hate this bill . <EOS> <EOP> `` But I thought , ' I 'm not married , it 's not my bag , I do n't really know anything about it , ' '' says Saskia . <EOS> <EOP> What she did know about , however , was online dating . <EOS> <EOP> Having spent seven to eight years doing it , her friends considered her a connoisseur . <EOS> <EOP> `` I just took a very light-hearted approach to it , I saw it as a bit of an adventure , or a story to share with married friends - they love that sort of stuff , '' she says . <EOS> <EOP> Who , then , is this bill actually supposed to make happy ? <EOS> Well , if all you really cared about was cutting taxes for rich people and creating the tantalizing prospect of taking Medicaid away from poor people down the road , this bill is for you . <EOS> <EOP> If you thought Obamacare more or less made sense , but the problem was the insurance it offered was too affordable and too good , then this bill definitely works for you . <EOS> <EOP> If you ’ re Mitch McConnell , and you were looking for something , anything , that could either pass quickly or be killed quickly , this bill might be for you . <EOS> <EOP> But if you ’ re like most people and you just want to see the health care system made better — if you want people to be able to afford insurance that protects them and their families — this bill is a disaster . <EOS> Its theory of insurance is there should be less insurance coverage . <EOS> Its theory of insurance design is insurance should cover fewer medical expenses and carry higher deductibles . <EOS> Its theory of cost control doesn ’ t exist . <EOS> Its theory of stabilizing insurance markets is to shovel subsidies directly to insurers as a payoff for participating . <EOS> Its theory of the system overall is that we spend too much money on health insurance for poor people and too little money on tax cuts for rich people . <EOS> <EOP> This is a bill designed to solve a political problem Republicans have : They need to do something they can call “ repeal and replace ” of Obamacare . <EOS> But its passage would create a much bigger political problem for them : They will own an unstable health care system that people hate . <EOS> <EOP> Wouldn ’ t it be easier just to cut taxes ? <EOS> ",1
"Obama spokesman defends reported $ 400,000 Wall Street-backed speech","A spokesman for Barack Obama spoke out Wednesday against critics who called out the former president for reportedly accepting a $ 400,000 speaking fee , backed by a Wall Street bank . <EOS> <EOP> Eric Schultz , the spokesman , told Fortune that in 2008 , then-candidate Obama pulled in more money than any candidate in history , and went on to “ implement the toughest reforms on Wall Street since FDR . ” <EOS> <EOP> Fox Business reported that Obama has agreed to speak at a Wall Street conference run by Cantor Fitzgerald LP . <EOS> The speaking fee will be $ 400,000 , which is nearly twice as much as Hillary Clinton , his secretary of state , and the 2016 Democratic Party candidate , charged private businesses for such events . <EOS> <EOP> Obama has agreed to speak at Cantor ’ s health care conference in September and will be the keynote luncheon speaker for one day during the event , people at the firm told Fox Business . <EOS> These people say Obama has signed the contract , but the company , a mid-sized New York-based investment bank , is waiting to coordinate with the former president before making a formal announcement . <EOS> <EOP> “ Is there an irony here because he spoke incessantly about the income gap and is now earning from those same people he criticized ? <EOS> Yes it is , ” said Hank Sheinkopf , a Democratic political consultant . <EOS> “ Should we expect it ? <EOS> Yes , we should because all former presidents do this . <EOS> He went on the attack against Wall Street and now he ’ s being fed by those same people he called ‘ fat cats ’ . <EOS> It ’ s more hypocritical than ironic . ” <EOS> <EOP> Schultz went on to say that Obama will continue to give the occasional speech , but he will devote much of his time to writing his book and “ focusing his post-presidency work on training and elevating a new generation of political leaders in America . ” <EOS> ",0

Chicago ’ s “ Dyke March ” under fire for alleged anti-Semitism,"The so-called “ Chicago Dyke March ” is facing criticism of alleged anti-Semitism . <EOS> <EOP> Three individuals who carried rainbow pride flags with Jewish Stars of David in the center were asked to leave the parade , according to a report by the LGBTQ newspaper The Windy City Times . <EOS> They were told that the flag “ made people feel unsafe ” and that the parade had a “ pro-Palestinian ” and “ anti-Zionist ” perspective . <EOS> <EOP> It is worth noting that none of these flags were Israeli . <EOS> They were simply Jewish , something that the people who raised objections assumed could be automatically conflated with Zionism . <EOS> <EOP> “ It was a flag from my congregation which celebrates my queer , Jewish identity which I have done for over a decade marching in the Dyke March with the same flag , ” Laurel Grauer , who was brandishing one of the flags , told The Windy City Times . <EOS> <EOP> This isn ’ t the first time that anti-Zionism has become a controversial issue in the Chicago gay rights community . <EOS> In January 2016 , anti-Zionist protesters chanted outside of a gay activism conference with Jewish participants by chanting , “ Hey hey , ho ho , pinkwashing has got to go. ” Pinkwashing refers to Israel ’ s touting of its strong pro-gay rights record , which anti-Zionists claim is used to distract from its alleged human rights abuses against Palestinians . <EOS> This also isn ’ t the first time that a left-wing activist movement has faced criticism for trying to push out Zionists . <EOS> Feminist Linda Sarsour stirred up controversy in March when she insisted that Zionists could not also be feminists . <EOS> “ You either stand up for the rights of all women , including Palestinians , or none . <EOS> There ’ s just no way around it , ” Sarsour told The Nation . <EOS> ",0
“ I would ’ ve never stood for it ” : Hillary Clinton “ won ’ t rule out ” contesting Trump ’ s election,"On Monday , as part of her post-election tour for her new book `` What Happened , '' Hillary Clinton appeared on a radio interview with host Terry Gross on WHYY 's `` Fresh Air , '' in which she found herself in a peculiar role-reversal with her former rival Donald Trump . <EOS> In her most incendiary comments since the election , Clinton admitted that she would not rule out questioning the legitimacy of Donald Trump ’ s victory if the investigation into election meddling reveals that Russia 's “ interference in the election is even deeper than we know now . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ No , I wouldn ’ t rule it out , ” Clinton responded when pressed by Gross . <EOS> <EOP> Clinton ’ s former campaign chairman , John Podesta , appeared on Monday before one of the Senate committees leading an investigation on Russia 's alleged role in the 2016 election . <EOS> Today , the former secretary of state expressly left open the possibility of a formal challenge of the results : <EOS> <EOP> Let me just put it this way , if I had lost the popular vote but won the electoral college and in my first day as president the intelligence community came to me and said , `` The Russians influenced the election , '' I would 've never stood for it . <EOS> Even though it might 've advantaged me , I would 've said , `` We 've got to get to the bottom of this . '' <EOS> I would 've set up an independent commission with subpoena power and everything else . <EOS> <EOP> Clinton quickly made clear that such a challenge would create an extremely uncertain situation and is wholly unlikely . <EOS> After noting that there have been “ scholars ” and “ academics ” who argue challenging the results would be possible , Clinton dismissed the idea : “ I just don ’ t think we have a mechanism . ” <EOS> <EOP> Clinton , of course , won the popular vote in November by nearly 3 million votes , but fell short in the Electoral College vote count . <EOS> Clinton argued during the campaign that questioning the integrity of the presidential election outcome constituted a `` direct threat '' to U.S. democracy , while Trump repeatedly insisted the system was `` rigged '' against him . <EOS> <EOP> Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Thursday that steps are “ underway ” to organize an “ international community effort ” to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad , a major policy shift triggered by the latest chemical weapons attack in the country ’ s ongoing civil war . <EOS> <EOP> In her interview with Gross , Clinton went on to compare the American election to the recent presidential election in Kenya , the results of which were tossed out over irregularities . <EOS> Clinton noted that the data analysis firm that worked for Kenyan incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta is connected to Trump allies including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon . <EOS> <EOP> You know , the Kenya election was just overturned and really what 's interesting about that — and I hope somebody writes about it , Terry — the Kenyan election was also a project of Cambridge Analytica , the data company owned by the Mercer family that was instrumental in the Brexit vote . <EOS> There 's now an investigation going on in the U.K. , because of the use of data and the weaponization of information . <EOS> They were involved in the Trump campaign after he got the nomination , and I think that part of what happened is Mercer said to Trump , We 'll help you , but you have to take Bannon as your campaign chief . <EOS> You 've got to take Kellyanne Conway and these other people who are basically Mercer protégées . <EOS> And so we know that there was this connection . <EOS> So what happened in Kenya , which I 'm only beginning to delve into , is that the Supreme Court there said there are so many really unanswered and problematic questions , we 're going to throw the election out and re-do it . <EOS> We have no such provision in our country . <EOS> And usually we do n't need it . <EOS> <EOP> You can listen to the full interview here . <EOS> ",1

Supreme Court : 5 cases Gorsuch will hear in his first month on the bench,"It was a grueling process from President Trump ’ s nomination of U.S . <EOS> Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch in January to the Supreme Court seat left vacant at Justice Antonin Scalia ’ s death to the Senate ’ s confirmation of him on Friday . <EOS> <EOP> But now comes the really hard work . <EOS> <EOP> With less than a month left in the court ’ s current sitting , Gorsuch will have to jump into hearings on a number of controversial issues that will not only gauge the 49-year-old Colorado native ’ s conservative credentials but also lay bare how he compares to his predecessor , Scalia . <EOS> <EOP> “ Scalia was not a monochromatic justice and I don ’ t think that Gorsuch is that way either , ” Stephen Wasby , a professor emeritus at the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs & Policy at the University of Albany , told Fox News . <EOS> <EOP> Here is a look at five cases that Gorsuch will hear in his first month , his responses to which will shed light on what kind of Supreme Court justice he will be : <EOS> <EOP> Dubbed by many observers as the hot-button issue case of this Supreme Court ’ s sitting and arguably the biggest church-state case in recent memory , the justices will be asked to address the question , “ Whether the exclusion of churches from an otherwise neutral and secular aid program violates the Free Exercise and Equal Protection Clauses when the state has no valid Establishment Clause concern . ” <EOS> <EOP> In layman ’ s terms , the preschool at Trinity Lutheran Church in Missouri filed suit after being denied state funds to improve a playground ’ s surface used by its preschool by replacing gravel with softer recycled rubber . <EOS> <EOP> The state funds are from a program that gives grants to nonprofits seeking a safer recreational environment for children . <EOS> Missouri 's law -- similar to those in 37 other states -- prohibits direct government aid to educational institutions that have a religious affiliation . <EOS> <EOP> Trinity Lutheran and its supporters are hoping that given his past rulings on religious liberty cases , Gorsuch will tip the scales in favor of the parochial schools . <EOS> While Gorsuch has not publicly weighed in on this case , many observers say his ruling on the Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius case indicates where he stands . <EOS> <EOP> In that case – where Hobby Lobby sued to challenge the Affordable Care Act ’ s requirement that employer ’ s insurance must cover all forms of birth control – Gorsuch wrote in his opinion that courts can ’ t “ decide whether a religious teaching about complicity imposes ‘ too much ’ moral disapproval on those only ‘ indirectly ’ assisting wrongful conduct . ” <EOS> <EOP> Gorsuch ’ s 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal law prohibited the ACA requirement from applying to closely held corporations and the ruling was later upheld in the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision . <EOS> <EOP> “ Gorsuch seems to be on the side believing that government programs should treat religious freedoms fairly and should recognize the rights of religious organizations to participate in public welfare-type programs , ” Stephen Wermiel , a professor at American University ’ s Washington School of Law told Fox News . <EOS> <EOP> Both of these cases deal with the Sixth Amendment , the right to a speedy and public trial , and both center around a defendant ’ s rights and counsel being misused . <EOS> <EOP> In the case of Kentel Weaver , who as a 16-year-old in 2003 murdered a 15-year-old boy , his legal team argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and he had inadequate representation . <EOS> A court officer kept the public , including his family , locked out for two days while a jury was selected and Weaver ’ s trial lawyers did not object to the move . <EOS> <EOP> Lawyers for Erick Davila – a Texas gang member convicted of killing a five-year-old girl and her grandmother in a drive-by shooting – question both whether he was provided with ineffective counsel and what legal remedies are afforded to capital defendants . <EOS> <EOP> The Stanford Law Review called Gorsuch ’ s rulings on Sixth Amendment cases both “ restrained ” and “ interpretive , ” noting that his opinions have stated a well-developed position on at least one aspect : “ ineffective assistance of counsel claims . ” <EOS> <EOP> Gorsuch ’ s idea of judicial restraint and pragmatism differentiates him from Scalia , whose time on the bench saw him frequently rule in favor of the defendant . <EOS> <EOP> The Supreme Court has long held that a defendant who pleads guilty based on bad advice can show prejudice by demonstrating “ a reasonable probability that , but for counsel ’ s errors , he … would have insisted on going to trial , ” the Stanford Law Review noted . <EOS> “ While he admitted that counsel can be ineffective at the plea bargaining phase , Gorsuch would only find a Sixth Amendment infringement where that ineffectiveness denied the defendant ‘ his constitutional entitlement to a trial . ’ ” <EOS> <EOP> The review added : “ [ A ] criminal defendant with Sixth Amendment claims can fairly expect an uphill battle to win his vote . ” <EOS> <EOP> In the last scheduled argument of the term , the justices will hear the case of Divna Maslenjak of Ohio -- an ethnic Serb from Bosnia – who was stripped of her U.S. citizenship for lying about the circumstances that brought her to this country . <EOS> <EOP> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit ruled -- in direct conflict with the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 1st , 4th , 7th and 9th Circuits -- that a naturalized American citizen can be stripped of her citizenship in a criminal proceeding based on immaterial false statements . <EOS> <EOP> Gorsuch ’ s record on immigration cases shows that he is neither a staunch defender nor a critic of immigrant rights . <EOS> During his time on the bench in the 10th Circuit , Gorsuch handled only a few prominent immigration-related cases and ruled in favor of the immigrant slightly less than half the time . <EOS> <EOP> When hearing Alejandre-Gallegos v. Holder last year , Gorsuch initiated disciplinary proceedings against an attorney who he stated had repeatedly done a poor job representing immigrants . <EOS> <EOP> Gorsuch , however , in the case Porro v. Barnes overturned a ruling in a lower court favoring an immigrant who had been shot with a Taser by jailers . <EOS> While Gorsuch said that the jail did ignore federal policy that prohibits the uses of Tasers on immigration detainees , he ruled that this action did not violate the person ’ s constitutional rights . <EOS> <EOP> Another case Gorsuch will hear centers on whether certain class-action securities lawsuits can be barred because they were filed too late . <EOS> <EOP> The retirement fund in California has sued various financial institutions over their alleged role in the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers . <EOS> <EOP> How the justices rule in this case is expected to have serious consequences for institutional investors and also will determine whether putative class members must file individual complaints before the three-year period imposed by Section 13 of the Securities Act has run out . <EOS> ",0

Dozens of NYPD officers rally with raised fists to help Colin Kaepernick secure an NFL contract,"A famed New York City Police Department detective rallied with dozens of his colleagues on Saturday to help NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick , a current league free agent , get signed to a team . <EOS> <EOP> Kaepernick is the former starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and created a wave of controversy about one year ago after he began his infamous national anthem protest , which involved him kneeling during the playing of the anthem . <EOS> He began the protest to bring attention to police brutality in the United States . <EOS> <EOP> According to the Associated Press , about 75 police officers rallied together in Brooklyn wearing matching black T-shirts that read , “ # imwithkap , ” on the front . <EOS> The AP reported the officers who gathered were “ mostly minority . ” <EOS> <EOP> While nearly all of those who gathered were a minority , one exception came in the form of 81-year-old retired NYPD detective Frank Serpico , who is known for his work in exposing deep corruption in the NYPD more than 40 years ago . <EOS> <EOP> “ He ’ s trying to hold up this government up to our founding fathers , ” Serpico said of Kaepernick . <EOS> <EOP> Serpico told the AP that although he isn ’ t a fan of American football , he believes it ’ s important for him to stand with Kaepernick . <EOS> <EOP> NYPD Sgt . <EOS> Edwin Raymond , who was leaving for work duties after the rally , explained that racial reconciliation is something our country has long needed , yet it has been ignored for just as long . <EOS> <EOP> “ What Colin Kaepernick did is try to bring awareness that this nation unfortunately has ignored for far too long , ” Raymond told the New York Daily News . <EOS> <EOP> “ And that ’ s the issue of racism in America and policing in America . <EOS> We decided to gather here today because of the way he ’ s being railroaded for speaking the obvious truth , ” he explained . <EOS> <EOP> At the end of the rally , the cops made a physical solidified stance with Kaepernick . <EOS> <EOP> “ Near the end of the rally , all involved raised their fists and took a synchronized knee in support of the one-time San Francisco starter , ” the Daily News reported . <EOS> <EOP> Contrary to what many believe , Kaepernick was not fired from his former team , which he led to the super bowl in 2013 . <EOS> Rather , he opted out of an option-year in his contract . <EOS> <EOP> He remains unsigned just weeks away from the start of the 2017 regular season . <EOS> Kaepernick ’ s supporters say the NFL has blackballed him over his unpopular protest , but league commissioner Roger Goodell said recently that the accusations aren ’ t true . <EOS> <EOP> “ He can ’ t be because we ’ re not , ” Goodell said last month . <EOS> “ The clubs are making those individual evaluations . ” <EOS> <EOP> Goodell ’ s comments came after several teams considered signing Kaepernick , but ultimately chose to go with someone else . <EOS> ",0
How the murderous MS-13 gang makes its money,"President Donald Trump is ready to crack down on the infamous , money-making MS-13 gang , after a violent quadruple homicide in Long Island , NY last week left four teenagers dead and badly beaten . <EOS> Trump is promising to remove the gang from US streets “ fast . ” <EOS> <EOP> MS-13 , a group that was started by Central American immigrants in Los Angeles in the 1980s , is known for its ruthless and violent tactics . <EOS> Most of the founding members were from El Salvador and fled to the US during the country ’ s civil war that lasted 12 years , from 1980-92 . <EOS> Since then the gang ’ s membership has ballooned to at least 10,000 members in the United States and more than 30,000 worldwide , according to the FBI and Treasury Department . <EOS> <EOP> The identities of the president 's guests at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach , Florida has been a mystery , and led three government-transparency groups to file a lawsuit under the Freedom Of Information Act . <EOS> <EOP> President Donald Trump has spent seven weekend this year at his sumptuous Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach , Florida , but the U.S. Secret Service says it has no records of who was admitted to the property to meet with him <EOS> <EOP> “ [ MS-13 ] is one of the most dangerous and rapidly expanding criminal gangs in the world today , ” Philip Holloway , a legal analyst and former police officer , told FOX Business . <EOS> “ MS-13 ’ s mottos is ‘ Mata , roba , viola , controla ’ ( Kill , steal , rape , control ) . ” <EOS> <EOP> Last month the White House responded to a judge 's mid-September deadline for releasing visitor records by handing over a single page listing Japanese officials who took part in a February visit by Prime Minister Shinzō Abe . <EOS> <EOP> The gang has managed to expand its business tentacles into a variety of illegal activities , despite sanctions levied against the group by the US Treasury Department under the Obama administration . <EOS> “ They are involved in multiple crimes including murder , racketeering , drug trafficking , sex trafficking and human trafficking including prostitution , ” Holloway said . <EOS> <EOP> Trump spent seven separate weekends at Mar-a-Lago between his inauguration and mid-April , holding meetings with White House staff and world leaders . <EOS> <EOP> But those fall under the Presidential Records Act , the agency contends , meaning the Secret Service does n't own or control them . <EOS> <EOP> MS-13 also uses violence as a means for extortion , which constitutes much of its income , University of Houston sociology professor Luis Salinas told FOX Business . <EOS> <EOP> “ A lot of the violence is part of the extortion … and prostitution . <EOS> Once they get here they get these individuals and extort money from their families . <EOS> They ’ re also into extortion for protection of this neighborhood or that neighborhood , ” Salinas said . <EOS> <EOP> In 2015 the US Treasury Department froze the assets of three members of the gang who were funneling funds back to higher-ups in El Salvador from prison . <EOS> These actions were an attempt “ disrupt ” MS-13 ’ s financial network by cutting off profits from illegal activities in the United States , the Treasury Department said . <EOS> In 2012 the Obama administration designated MS-13 a transnational crime organization and implemented sanctions against six members in 2013 . <EOS> <EOP> While the US government attempts to target MS-13 ’ s earnings , targeting its culture is proving more difficult . <EOS> The fierce loyalty among members is unique , Ron Hosko , former assistant director of the FBI ’ s Criminal Investigative Division , told FOX Business . <EOS> <EOP> “ They ’ re very cohesive and often directed by imprisoned bosses in El Salvador to recruit and expand in American communities . <EOS> That tends to mean there ’ s an aggressive internal enforcement mechanism which equates to internal discipline involving physical violence and murder for disrespect or betrayal , ” he said . <EOS> <EOP> Membership in street gangs showed no signs of decreasing , according to the FBI ’ s 2015 National Gang Report , and MS-13 was identified as one of the top gangs involved in cross-border crimes . <EOS> Recently , law enforcement has taken a tougher stance on making arrests ; a move spurred by Attorney General Jeff Session ’ s focus on illegal immigrant crime , Hosko said . <EOS> <EOP> “ MS is a clear example [ of illegal immigrant crime ] . <EOS> Affiliates would cross the border and make their way to American enclaves where they found friends and relatives living here already , ” he said . <EOS> “ Citizenship is a combination of American born ( many to illegals ) and illegal immigrants . ” <EOS> <EOP> Salinas said about 60 to 70 percent of current U.S. members in MS-13 are immigrants , the majority of which could be illegal . <EOS> <EOP> On Tuesday during an interview on Fox News , Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he believes the gang “ could qualify ” as a terrorist group . <EOS> In El Salvador , MS-13 has already been designated as a terrorist organization . <EOS> <EOP> 'The ... search and review of records confirmed that there is no system for keeping track of Presidential visitors at Mar-a-Lago , as there is at the White House Complex , ' wrote Kim E. Campbell , head of the Secret Service 's Liaison Division . <EOS> ",1
” Maverick ’ John McCain Defects From Trump & GOP ; Releases Heroic Military Announcement,"Remember the tweets that took the world by surprise earlier this year in which the president announced a plan to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. Armed Forces ? <EOS> On Friday , the president made those tweets official , signing an official directive telling the Pentagon to halt the implementation of an Obama-era order allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military . <EOS> <EOP> Adding insult to injury , the president ’ s directive ordered the military to no longer pay for hormone therapies for transgender persons currently serving in the U.S. Armed Forces . <EOS> <EOP> Now , longtime Arizona GOP Senator John McCain has joined the chorus of voices speaking out against the move . <EOS> <EOP> In a statement published on his website shortly after news about Trump ’ s official directive came out , the Senate Armed Forces Committee Chairman and brain cancer survivor said : <EOS> <EOP> The directive that the president signed on Friday tells the Defense Department to look into what the fate of currently serving transgender military personnel ’ s careers should be . <EOS> In the meantime , it calls on the Armed Forces to stop accepting transgender individuals for service . <EOS> <EOP> As McCain indicates , although the president has claimed to the contrary , there is no evidence that disallowing transgender people from serving in the Armed Forces would actually save the government any meaningful amount of money . <EOS> <EOP> The costs associated with gender identity specific medical services for transgender people in the military are a tiny fraction of the costs associated with treatment for erectile dysfunction . <EOS> The president ’ s claim that transgender people disrupt the flow of the Armed Forces is that ridiculous . <EOS> <EOP> McCain added in his statement that the Defense Department ’ s “ ongoing study on this issue should be completed before any decisions are made with regard to accession , ” and that his committee would “ continue to conduct oversight on this important issue . ” <EOS> <EOP> The Senator has come out strongly against the president on numerous issues in the past , including , for example , that of his foreign policy . <EOS> McCain also cast what has been widely seen as the deciding vote that led to the failure of GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act , something that Trump paraded into office promising to get done . <EOS> <EOP> The president ’ s move to ban transgender people from the military has , unsurprisingly , been met with wide criticism . <EOS> <EOP> The American Civil Liberties Union has pledged to sue the president for his ban , posting a message to Twitter on Friday telling the president , “ We ’ ll see you in court . ” <EOS> <EOP> That phrase has become somewhat of a trademark rallying cry in the ACLU ’ s fight against the Trump Administration ’ s oppressive policies , a fight which has proven successful . <EOS> For example , earlier this year , the ACLU helped lead the first successful legal challenges against the Trump Administration ’ s controversial Muslim-targeting travel ban . <EOS> It remains to be seen how successful the ACLU ’ s lawsuit against the president ’ s transgender military ban is . <EOS> ",0
Liberals Just Debuted NASTY New First Lady As HUGE ‘ F You ’ To Melania For Her Replacement,"For Verma , it began in 2006 . <EOS> <EOP> Liberals have had an extremely hard time coping ever since their crooked queen lost to Trump . <EOS> We saw them curled up in fetal positions on election night , as their world came crashing down as the votes for Trump continued to flow in along with the unbelievable reality of who would be the 43rd president . <EOS> Now liberals have decided to officially replace Melania Trump as First Lady , by declaring a disgusting replacement as a huge “ F you ” to our first family . <EOS> <EOP> Liberals have found a number of different ways to cope with the disappointment of Trump becoming president . <EOS> Some snowflakes have chosen to turn violent , as we frequently see groups like Antifa letting out their frustrations by donning black outfits and beating the crap out of Trump supporters with flag poles and baseball bats . <EOS> <EOP> Other liberals choose to live in an alternate universe , where they can pretend that Trump isn ’ t the president and Melania isn ’ t the first lady . <EOS> Following the election , a fake news site called HillaryBeatTrump.org , was created , devoted to covering stories where liberals can pretend that Hillary won the election , with headlines like , “ Long live the true president , Hillary Rodham Clinton , ” and “ White House Chief of Staff Huma Abedin gushes that Hillary Clinton is the best boss ever . ” <EOS> <EOP> Other liberals will cope by clinging onto the hope that they can get Trump impeached , as they continue to invent fake news about Trump , asserting he ’ s in bed with the Russians and a white supremacist neo-Nazi KKK member . <EOS> <EOP> As the liberal insanity at this point reaches a fever pitch , now liberals are ousting Melania Trump as the First Lady , and declaring Kim Kardiashian as “ America ’ s First Lady . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ Kim Kardashian West is the subject of a cover story alongside her daughter North in the new September issue of Interview magazine that declares her “ America ’ s New First Lady , ” Free Beacon reported . <EOS> <EOP> Flaming liberal and transgender civil rights activist Janet Mock dreamed up the fantasy and directed the photoshoot , where she dressed Kardashian up in Jackie-O inspired outfits and hairdo . <EOS> In the opening paragraph of the article , Mock writes , “ If anyone can be said to embody the American Dream , it ’ s Kim Kardashian West. ” On the front page of the magazine the caption reads , “ America ’ s New First Lady , Kim Kardashian-West and Her Daughter , North West . <EOS> <EOP> A decade later , Verma has taken on her biggest challenge yet -- and one that underscores Pence 's influence in a signature policy area in Trump 's still-young administration . <EOS> <EOP> Liberals everywhere were in full celebration mode , with MTV ’ s website celebrating that Melania has been officially ousted as America ’ s first lady . <EOS> It read , “ Some may think that Melania Trump is this country ’ s First Lady , but the newest issue of Interview begs to differ . <EOS> The magazine unveiled its latest cover on Monday morning , and it declares none other than Kim Kardashian West as “ America ’ s New First Lady. ” Let the backlash begin ! ” <EOS> <EOP> `` When they came back , she was the one who had worked out the details of the plan , '' Daniels said . <EOS> `` And the central tenets of that were some skin in the game . '' <EOS> <EOP> Of course the magazine never mentioned Melania Trump as the true first lady , as ACTUAL REALITY would completely destroy the liberal fantasy of unicorns and rainbows . <EOS> It ’ s unreal that liberals would pick such an unclassy person as Kardiashian as America ’ s first lady if they had their choice . <EOS> Kim ‘ sex tape ’ Kardashian is nothing more than a silicone-injected promiscuous woman who possesses zero talent , other than possessing the skills to balance a glass of champagne on her enormous fake ass , and having sex with black men on camera . <EOS> <EOP> He said she `` came to it as a technocrat '' rather than a consultant focused on pushing conservative ideology . <EOS> <EOP> As liberals continue to live life in their alternate universe , this is nothing more than passive aggressive attack on Melania , as leftists have been incessant in their efforts to undermine her as America ’ s first lady since day one . <EOS> Melania has been nothing but a class act since the day she day Trump became president , devoting her free time to helping our wounded warriors , and visiting children ’ s hospitals across the world . <EOS> <EOP> Amanda Shea from Freedom Daily summed it up perfectly saying : “ For this first time in eight years , America has a first family which we can truly be proud of , who genuinely care about the people of this great nation which they consider an honor to represent . <EOS> The Trumps ’ love this country and rather than criticizing the foundation America was built on , trying to change it , and apologizing for it to those it offends , they respect what our forefathers created that made it the greatest nation in the world . <EOS> <EOP> Sorry , liberals . <EOS> No matter how many stupid declarations and fake stories you create to make yourselves feel better , Melania Trump is America ’ s first lady , and your ridiculous delusions will never change that ! <EOS> <EOP> `` I had heard great things about Seema Verma from a number of state Medicaid directors who know her well . <EOS> This was all confirmed when I spent some time speaking with her , '' Scully said . <EOS> <EOP> Share this story if you ’ re proud AS HELL to have Melania as our first lady ! <EOS> ",1
"Right after Trump blamed high drug prices on campaign cash , drugmakers gave more","“ The cost of medicine in this country is outrageous , ” President Trump said at a rally in Louisville , Ky. , two months after his inauguration . <EOS> He went on about how identical pills have vastly lower price tags in Europe . <EOS> <EOP> “ You know why ? ” the president asked , before spreading his hands wide . <EOS> “ Campaign contributions , who knows . <EOS> But somebody is getting very rich . ” <EOS> <EOP> The next day , drugmakers donated more money to political campaigns than they had on any other day in 2017 so far , according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of campaign spending in the first half of the year reported in Federal Election Commission filings . <EOS> <EOP> Eight pharmaceutical political action committees made 134 contributions , spread over 77 politicians , on March 21 . <EOS> They spent $ 279,400 in all , showering Republicans and Democrats in both legislative bodies with campaign cash , according to FEC filings . <EOS> The second-highest one-day contribution tally was $ 203,500 , on June 20 . <EOS> <EOP> Brendan Fischer , who directs election reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center , said he found the timing of the contributions interesting : “ I think it ’ s entirely possible that the drug companies sought to curry favor with members of Congress in order to head off any sort of potential attack on their industry by the press or by the federal government . ” <EOS> <EOP> During the Louisville rally , Trump also promised to lower drug prices , and pharmaceutical stocks tumbled afterward . <EOS> <EOP> Although drug industry PACs have different structures and protocols , they are equipped to mobilize quickly to disperse funds to legislators . <EOS> <EOP> “ Writing a check doesn ’ t require much beyond putting pen to paper , ” Fischer said . <EOS> <EOP> FEC records show Merck ’ s PAC led the way that day , donating $ 148,000 to 60 candidates on March 21 . <EOS> House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) received three maximum contributions to his various PACs from the drugmaker , totaling $ 15,000 . <EOS> Behind him with $ 7,500 was Sen. Tom Carper ( D-Del . <EOS> ) , who sits on the Senate Finance Committee . <EOS> <EOP> Merck spokeswoman Claire Gillepsie said the contributions were “ not tied to specific events . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ Decisions on contributions are made at the beginning of a cycle and are approved by a contributions committee , ” she said . <EOS> A White House official referred requests for comment to the presidential campaign , which did not respond . <EOS> <EOP> Companies may donate funds or lobby ahead of impending legislative issues and executive orders , or they may react to something a politician says . <EOS> <EOP> “ Presidents get a lot of attention to what they say , ” said former congressman Lee Hamilton , who founded the Indiana University Center on Representative Government after three decades in the House of Representatives . <EOS> “ [ Companies ] have to react to that and defend the drug prices . ” <EOS> <EOP> Overall , FEC records show Merck spent $ 242,500 on campaign contributions and $ 3.7 million on lobbying in the first half of 2017 . <EOS> <EOP> The drugmaker , which makes diabetes pill Januvia , cancer drug Keytruda and shingles vaccine Zostavax , responded to outrage over drug prices earlier this year by revealing on its website that the average list prices of its drugs increased from 7.4 percent to 10.5 percent each year since 2010 . <EOS> Merck said discounts and rebates also increased , meaning it took home less money . <EOS> But Thomson Reuters pointed out that the price increases outpaced inflation . <EOS> <EOP> FEC records don ’ t indicate why a company donated to a politician or what that contribution led to , but when House Democrats accused Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( R-Utah ) of failing to schedule a hearing on prescription drug price hikes in 2015 , The Intercept pointed out that the pharmaceutical industry had been among Chaffetz ’ s top campaign contributors . <EOS> <EOP> Pharmaceutical lobbying dollars have also swelled in 2017 , Kaiser Health News previously reported . <EOS> In their disclosures , drug companies listed tax reform and drug pricing among issues on which they lobbied Congress . <EOS> <EOP> March 21 was also the date of the National Republican Congressional Committee ’ s annual fundraising dinner , featuring Trump as keynote speaker . <EOS> The event , which raises money for House Republicans , drew a record-breaking $ 30 million from a variety of industries , the NRCC reported . <EOS> <EOP> But on that day , drugmakers also gave generously to Democrats and senators , according to FEC filings . <EOS> <EOP> Pfizer and Novo Nordisk PACs donated $ 76,900 and $ 38,500 on March 21 , respectively , to several dozen candidates on March 21 , according to their filings . <EOS> Five additional pharmaceutical PACs spent between $ 1,000 and $ 5,000 on contributions that day . <EOS> <EOP> The companies say the timing was coincidental . <EOS> A Novo Nordisk spokesman said the March 21 contributions from its PAC had been scheduled in advance “ and in no way were tied to any specific statement . ” <EOS> <EOP> Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo said it takes three to four weeks to orchestrate and approve a PAC contribution . <EOS> <EOP> “ Pfizer ’ s political contributions to candidates and elected officials from both parties are led by two guiding principles — preserve and further the incentives for innovation , and protect and expand access to medicines and vaccines for the patients we serve , ” Castillo said . <EOS> <EOP> Pfizer ’ s PAC donated more than any pharmaceutical PAC in the first half of 2017 , contributing $ 418,400 in all — nearly 70 percent more than the first six months of the 2015 election cycle , according to FEC records . <EOS> In February of this year , the company ’ s CEO was among several executives from drugmaking firms and other global companies to pen a letter to Congress in support of tax reform . <EOS> In December 2016 , Pfizer received a letter from the Senate Special Committee on Aging , asking it to explain its price increases for the opioid overdose reversal drug , naloxone . <EOS> <EOP> “ Pfizer is committed to addressing the prevention , treatment and effective response to the growing opioid abuse in the United States , ” Castillo said , adding that the company is donating up to 1 million naloxone doses and $ 1 million in grants toward opioid addiction awareness efforts . <EOS> <EOP> Novo Nordisk has spent $ 178,000 on campaign contributions so far this year , or nearly four times more than it spent the first six months of 2015 , according to its filings with the FEC . <EOS> The company is one of the top three insulin makers , and in July , Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D-Minn. ) sent the companies letters asking them to justify their price increases . <EOS> In November , Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) and Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D-Md . ) <EOS> asked the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the insulin makers for possible price collusion . <EOS> The companies have denied the allegations . <EOS> <EOP> “ We ’ re certainly aware of policymakers ’ concerns about the price of insulin , and we ’ re committed to collaborate with all those involved in the healthcare supply chain to ensure patient access , ” said Novo Nordisk spokesman Ken Inchausti . <EOS> <EOP> “ From the public record , you can ’ t tell for sure ” what prompted the spike in political contributions from pharmaceutical companies , said Tony Raymond , a former analyst at the Federal Election Commission who founded Political Money Line to track campaign finance . <EOS> The PACs could have been “ killing two birds with one stone ” by donating to legislators across the board on the night of the NRCC fundraiser , or they could have been responding to what Trump said . <EOS> <EOP> “ We ’ re talking about a couple phone calls and then they could courier a check over to someone , ” he said . <EOS> <EOP> Kaiser Health News , a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide , is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation . <EOS> ",0

"Michael Chabon , Ayelet Waldman Pen Antisemitic Letter to Jews Who Support Trump","Chabon and Waldman , who were earnest supporters of President Barack Obama , and said nothing when he abandoned Israel and elevated the antisemitic Iranian regime , published their letter on Medium on Thursday . <EOS> <EOP> Using classic antisemitic tropes , they address Jews who may support Trump because of “ private business deals ” or other personal interests — “ You entered into negotiations , cut deals , made contracts with him and his government ” — and urge them to turn against him . <EOS> <EOP> During the 2016 election , Judge and his Idiocracy co-writer Etan Cohen , came up with an idea to create a series of parody campaign ads starring Crews ’ Camacho . <EOS> Unfortunately , Rupert Murdoch ’ s 21st Century Fox , which still owns the film and its characters , declined to give them permission . <EOS> It didn ’ t help that the ads were being billed as explicitly anti-Trump , despite Judge ’ s insistence otherwise . <EOS> <EOP> In retrospect , it ’ s unlikely that ads highlighting the similarities between Trump and a man who emerged from a cloud of fog to address the nation as loud guitars wailed in the background would have changed anyone ’ s minds . <EOS> They may have even made Trump ’ s voters like him more . <EOS> <EOP> Addressing casino magnate Sheldon Adelson directly , they turn up the antisemitic rhetoric , accusing him of calculating “ that money trumps hate , or that a million dollars ’ worth of access can protect you from one boot heel at the door . ” <EOS> <EOP> Chabon and Waldman also resort to blatant lies : “ You have counted carefully as each appointment to his administration of an avowed white supremacist , anti-Semite , neo-Nazi or crypto-fascist appeared to be counterbalanced by the appointment of a fellow Jew , ” they say , providing no proof whatsoever that Trump has appointed anyone that matches any of those descriptions . <EOS> <EOP> They single out White House adviser Steve Bannon as a “ white supremacist godfather , ” a complete slander that has no basis in reality . <EOS> <EOP> They claim that President Trump “ expressed admiration and sympathy for a group of white supremacist demonstrators who marched through the streets of Charlottesville , ” when in fact he condemned “ this egregious display of hatred , bigotry , and violence ” on Saturday , and explicitly condemned white supremacists on Monday and Tuesday . <EOS> <EOP> Chabon and Waldman , who presumably understand the importance of words , seem to misconstrue Trump ’ s defense Tuesday of legitimate protesters — whose presence was confirmed by the New York Times , no less — as a defense of the extremists he repeatedly denounced . <EOS> <EOP> They also claim , falsely and illogically , that if extremist groups say they support Trump , that means he supports them in return , despite his repeated disavowals . <EOS> <EOP> Chabon and Waldman reserve their ugliest language for Trump ’ s Jewish son-in-law , Jared Kushner : “ To Jared Kushner : You have one minute to do whatever it takes to keep the history of your people from looking back on you as among its greatest traitors , and greatest fools ; that minute is nearly past . ” <EOS> <EOP> They condescend to Ivanka Trump , addressing her as an ignorant convert ( original emphasis ) : “ To Ivanka Trump : Allow us to teach you an ancient and venerable phrase , long employed by Jewish parents and children to one another at such moments of family crisis : I ’ ll sit shiva for you . <EOS> Try it out on your father ; see how it goes . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ Sitting shiva ” refers to the ritual of mourning , meaning that Chabon and Waldman are urging Ivanka Trump to threaten to declare her father dead to her as a way of intimidating him . <EOS> <EOP> Finally , having declared the Trump administration a Nazi-like regime , Chabon and Waldman declare that Jews who support Trump are the equivalent of Nazi collaborators : <EOS> <EOP> Chabon and Waldman ’ s letter , which can be read here in full , is being circulated by liberal Jews to their relatives and friends in an effort to pressure them into opposing Trump . <EOS> <EOP> Joel B.

"Army updates transgender rules , delays recruits until 2018","She added that “ The notion , which some people are trying to suggest , that by asking for the identity of the American person is the same is leaking it — that ’ s completely false . <EOS> There is no equivalence between so-called unmasking and leaking . ” <EOS> <EOP> US Army service members are being directed as to how to treat their transgender peers under new policies that also outline requirements for transitioning while in service and the use of gender-specific facilities on base . <EOS> <EOP> In accordance with policy changes approved by former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter , the US Army has crafted training manuals on how to deal with transgender service members and those who undergo gender transition while serving in the military . <EOS> <EOP> The new “ Tier Three Transgender Training ” policies were laid out in a powerpoint presentation and accompanying lesson plan published by the Federalist on Wednesday . <EOS> <EOP> Last Friday , Defense Secretary Jim Mattis delayed processing transgender recruits until January 1 , 2018 , in order to give the joint chiefs time to review the potential impact on “ readiness and lethality of our forces. ” However , the delay does not prevent soldiers that are currently serving from transitioning . <EOS> <EOP> The force-wide policies begin by defining the difference between a service member ’ s sexual identity and gender identity . <EOS> The Army defines a service member ’ s sex through their biology , while they define a service member ’ s gender as “ the socially defined roles and characteristics of being male and female associated with that sex . ” <EOS> <EOP> The Army then defines a transgender soldier as any service member who has received a medical diagnosis that gender transition is “ medically necessary. ” The diagnosis must be supported by a military medical provider and the transitioning soldier must notify their chain of command about the diagnosis as well as the estimated date their gender marker will be changed . <EOS> <EOP> As part of its daily wrap of the Susan Rice newsflow , which focused on her first media appearance since she was “ outed ” as the persona responsible for “ unmasking ” members of team Trump , the WSJ provides two new pieces of incremental information : i ) in addition to Michael Flynn , at least one more member of the Trump transition team was “ unmasked ” in intelligence reports due to multiple foreign conversations that weren ’ t related to Russia ; and ii ) Rice wasn ’ t the administration official who instigated Mr. Flynn ’ s unmasking , confirming there is at least one more high-level official giving “ unmasking ” orders . <EOS> <EOP> Once a military medical provider has confirmed the transgender service member has completed the medical care necessary to achieve “ stability in the preferred gender , ” they may request approval to change to their “ gender marker ” in the Army ’ s personnel management system , the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System ( DEERS ) . <EOS> The soldier would also be required to change their gender designation on their passport or birth certificate to their preferred gender . <EOS> <EOP> After a service member switches their gender marker , they will be expected to “ adhere to Army standards applicable to the preferred gender , ” including using billeting , bathroom , and shower facilities that match their gender marker in DEERS . <EOS> <EOP> The training manuals provide a real world example of a transgender service member in transition from male to female , who begins using the female barracks , bathroom , and shower facilities . <EOS> <EOP> And this is where the WSJ comes in , with the new info that according to a Republican official familiar with deliberations by GOP lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee said that the names of two U.S. citizens who were part of Mr. Trump ’ s transition team have been unmasked in intelligence reports . <EOS> One is Mr. Flynn and the other hasn ’ t been identified . <EOS> The report involving Mr. Flynn documented phone conversations he had in late December with the Russian ambassador to the U.S . <EOS> <EOP> The Army directs other service members to “ accept living and working conditions that are often austere , primitive , and characterized by little or no privacy , ” adding that transgender service members “ are not required to modify or adjust their behavior based on the fact that they do not ‘ match ’ other Soldiers . ” <EOS> <EOP> Commanders do have the option to alter the facilities “ in the interest of maintaining morale , good order , and discipline and consistent with performance of the mission. ” However , they do not have the option to designate , modify or construct transgender-only areas . <EOS> Any modifications that are made must be available for all soldiers to use . <EOS> <EOP> “ Unmasking ” is a term used when the identity of a U.S. citizen or lawful resident is revealed in classified intelligence reports . <EOS> Normally , when government officials receive intelligence reports , the names of American citizens are redacted to protect their privacy . <EOS> But officials can request that names , listed as “ U.S . <EOS> Person 1 , ” for example , be unmasked internally in order to give context about the potential value of the intelligence . <EOS> Unmasking is justified for national security reasons but is governed by strict rules across the U.S. intelligence apparatus that make it illegal to pursue for political reasons or to leak classified information generated by the process . <EOS> <EOP> The training documents state that service members should treat transgender soldiers with dignity and respect and never ask about another service member ’ s gender identity or disclose the information without their permission . <EOS> <EOP> “ Commanders should approach a Soldier undergoing gender transition in the same way they would approach a Soldier undergoing any medically necessary treatment , ” the documents states . <EOS> <EOP> “ Personal information regarding transgender Soldiers should be safeguarded to the same extent as comparable information regarding any other Soldier . ” <EOS> <EOP> On June 30 , 2016 , Carter announced a new Army policy that allows transgender service members to serve openly and provides them with a process to transition while serving in the military . <EOS> <EOP> “ Otherwise qualified service members can no longer be involuntarily separated , discharged or denied reenlistment or continuation of service just for being transgender , ” Carter said at a news briefing , adding , that transgender service members , “ like all other service members , will get all medical care their doctors deem necessary . ” <EOS> <EOP> The WSJ then reports that Rice had requested the unmasking of at least one <EOS> ",1
Newt Gingrich compares Trump to former president who engineered genocide of native tribes,"In an interview with CBS This Morning on Tuesday , former House Speaker and GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich called President Trump a “ remarkable ” and “ historic ” figure , comparing him to the seventh president of the United States , Andrew Jackson . <EOS> <EOP> “ I think Trump is a remarkable figure , ” Gingrich said , responding to questions about the president veering off course and antagonizing his own party ahead of a major budget and tax reform battle . <EOS> “ I think he ’ s a historic figure , he ’ s certainly probably the biggest change agent since Andrew Jackson in the 1820s and 1830s . ” <EOS> <EOP> Despite the fact that it was intended to be complimentary , the Trump-Jackson comparison is unfortunate . <EOS> Jackson , a historic figure with a number of military achievements under his belt , admittedly shares certain similarities with the current president , including his anti-establishment legacy and , as one onlooker at the time put it , the “ rabble mob ” he brought with him to the White House after his inauguration in 1829 . <EOS> <EOP> But the seventh president is also notorious for a number of troubling , inhumane reasons : Jackson was a slave-owner who offered rewards to anyone who gave escaped slaves especially cruel beatings . <EOS> At the time of his death he owned approximately 150 slaves , though it ’ s been estimated that , over the course of his lifetime , he owned over 300 . <EOS> <EOP> Jackson is perhaps most famous for engineering one of the worst genocides in American history . <EOS> A longtime proponent of removing native tribes who were taking up what he considered to be valuable land meant for white settlers , Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act in 1830 , eventually forcing nearly 50,000 indigenous people off their lands and into the West . <EOS> In the winter of 1838 alone , some 4,000 Native Americans died along the Trail of Tears . <EOS> <EOP> In certain ways , the Trump-Jackson comparison seems depressingly fitting : since his own inauguration in January , Trump has become laser-focused on the removal of certain populations of people from the United States , including undocumented immigrants and their children , as well as on banning travelers and immigrants from several Muslim-majority nations . <EOS> His antagonistic views toward social justice movements meant to draw attention to the deaths of minority populations , such as Black Lives Matter , has also drawn criticism . <EOS> And as ThinkProgress ’ Josh Israel pointed out in March , “ Jackson , like Trump , preferred to ignore federal courts rather than enforce constitutional protections for all people . ” <EOS> <EOP> But , given Gingrich ’ s praise on Tuesday morning , it ’ s clear that many don ’ t view these comparisons negatively — quite the opposite , in fact . <EOS> <EOP> Trump himself has touted those similarities in the past , using them to prop up his own legacy and play himself off as a change-maker . <EOS> During a speech this past March at Jackson ’ s Nashville estate and plantation , The Hermitage , Trump noted , “ It was during the revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite . <EOS> Does that sound familiar ? ” <EOS> ",0
"White nationalist banned by Facebook over hate speech but Facebook leaves up ISIS vids , other extreme content","Is there really double standards for banning those who engage in hate speech on Facebook ? <EOS> <EOP> ( INTELLIHUB ) — Various Facebook and Instagram accounts connected to a white nationalist who attended the Charlottesville rally were deleted for violating the companies hate speech rules . <EOS> <EOP> White nationalist Christopher Cantwell , who was recently featured in a Vice documentary on the rally ’ s aftermath , is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an extremist but says that Facebook ’ s maneuver blatant censorship of free speech . <EOS> <EOP> In a phone interview , Cantwell told the Associated Press : “ I ’ m not surprised by almost any of this because the whole thing we are complaining about here is that we are trying to express our views , and everybody is going through extraordinary lengths to make sure we are not heard . ” <EOS> <EOP> The commander called the device the “ father of all bombs , ” comparing it to the US GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb ( MOAB ) , commonly known as the “ mother of all bombs. ” Since the American device weighs 9.8 tons and yields 11 tons in TNT equivalent , the IRGC commander presumably referred to the weight of the new Iranian ordnance rather than its destructive potential . <EOS> <EOP> “ Frankly , whatever you think of my views , that is very scary to me , ” he said . <EOS> “ Facebook and Instagram is one thing but not being able to participate in the financial system because of your political opinions is something that , you know , people should worry about in America . ” <EOS> <EOP> Interestingly enough , Facebook may have double standards depending on what kind of so-called hate speech one engages in . <EOS> For example : According to a PJ Media report , Facebook has refused to remove user-flagged ( ISIS ) videos posted by terror groups and has refused to remove user-flagged graphic sexual content picturing minors . <EOS> ",1
Leaked memos show Jeff Sessions 's DOJ aims to undermine due process for immigrants,"The Trump administration ’ s immigration crackdown , as broad and thorough as it ’ s been , has run time and again into one big obstacle : laws that guarantee due process to many immigrants apprehended without papers , whether they ’ re asylum seekers caught at the US border or immigrants living in the US caught by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) . <EOS> <EOP> But Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice have the immigration court system surrounded . <EOS> And now , like an anaconda , they ’ re beginning to squeeze . <EOS> <EOP> As part of a broader attack on what it calls the “ abuse ” of asylum by children and families arriving from Central America , the administration is considering — according to a September memo obtained by CNN ’ s Tal Kopan — allowing judges to strip people who come to the US as “ unaccompanied children ” of the legal protections that status provides if they turn 18 while they ’ re still in immigration proceedings , or if they ’ re reunited with a parent in the US . <EOS> <EOP> Meanwhile , a report from the Washington Post ’ s Maria Sacchetti indicates that the Department of Justice wants to start rating immigration judges based on how many cases they resolve — which would put pressure on them to resolve cases more quickly and show less leniency toward immigrants . <EOS> <EOP> These moves aren ’ t about making more people eligible for deportation . <EOS> They ’ re about making fewer people eligible for a full legal process before getting deported . <EOS> The Trump administration , and the Department of Justice in particular , is renewing its efforts to deter people from coming to the US without papers — even to seek humanitarian protection , as US and international law allows them to do — by making that protection as difficult as possible to get . <EOS> <EOP> Here ’ s the problem the Trump administration is trying to address : A large portion of the people who are currently coming to the US without papers are coming as children , or parents with children , from Central America ( specifically Guatemala , Honduras , and El Salvador ) . <EOS> They ’ re seeking humanitarian protection from gang violence in their home countries . <EOS> And Border Patrol agents , under both US and international law , are obligated to allow them to seek it rather than simply turning them away . <EOS> <EOP> To the Trump administration , though , this isn ’ t an example of border security working — it ’ s a loophole being exploited by people who just want to sneak into the US . <EOS> Attorney General Sessions ( who gave a speech to immigration judges on Thursday about the “ crisis ” of asylum abuse ) and other administration officials say that too many people are being allowed to stay in the US on the basis of “ credible fear ” of persecution , and that once they ’ re released from custody , they are caught up in a years-long , backlogged immigration court process — or simply disappear into American communities rather than showing up for their court dates . <EOS> <EOP> They ’ re partly right . <EOS> A majority of people pass their “ credible fear ” screenings , though that number is dropping as the Trump administration has started to raise alarms with employees about asylum abuse : The approval rate for “ credible fear ” was 81 percent in October and only 68 percent in June . <EOS> ( Sessions and other Trump officials , unsurprisingly , routinely claim that 89 percent of credible fear applications are being approved — which was true in 2014 but isn ’ t anymore — to make the problem seem dire . ) <EOS> <EOP> The immigration court backlog is , in fact , the biggest obstacle to large-scale deportations — both of asylum seekers and of unauthorized immigrants living in the US arrested by ICE agents . <EOS> Many immigrants don ’ t ultimately prevail in immigration court , but the time it takes for them to build their cases ( and the fact that immigration courts are understaffed ) means that it usually takes months or years for a judge to reach that conclusion . <EOS> <EOP> And many people do miss their court hearings once they ’ ve settled in the US , though it ’ s not clear how many of them were lying about their asylum claims ; how many simply didn ’ t know when their court date was ; and how many figured out that the judge was unlikely to approve their asylum claims , regardless of whether they were telling the truth . <EOS> <EOP> But the Trump administration can ’ t simply start turning people away or detaining them en masse . <EOS> There are laws governing how they have to treat asylum seekers — and how they have to treat families . <EOS> And people who come to the US as unaccompanied children are given certain legal protections under a 2008 anti-trafficking law — which , among other things , prevents the government from deporting them without a court hearing or deporting them to a third country . <EOS> <EOP> That gives the Trump administration two options : to try to limit the reach of those laws so that fewer people are guaranteed a full judicial process ; or to try to make sure that as often as possible , that process ends with immigrants being denied protection . <EOS> <EOP> The new memo , written by the general counsel of the Executive Office of Immigration Review ( which oversees immigration judges ) , is trying to do everything possible under the executive branch ’ s power to change the anti-trafficking law . <EOS> <EOP> It recommends that the label of “ unaccompanied child ” — and the protections that come with it — should be stripped by an immigration judge if the immigrant is no longer a minor , or if he ’ s no longer unaccompanied . <EOS> ( Right now , the label of “ unaccompanied child ” is basically assigned when an immigrant arrives in the US and is not reviewed by the judge assigned to process the case . ) <EOS> <EOP> The first category could hurt people who arrived in the US in their late or even mid-teens — given the lengthy immigration court backlog , it ’ s possible that it would take a few years for an immigrant to get final approval for humanitarian protections , and that a 15-year-old could simply be stalled in court until turning 18 and becoming imminently deportable . <EOS> <EOP> The second category would hurt children who came to meet parents living in the US ( whether those parents are legal immigrants or not ) . <EOS> The Trump administration has already started targeting unauthorized immigrants whose children arrive unaccompanied ; ICE has targeted them in nationwide raids . <EOS> Now , it ’ s sending the message to parents that they are putting not only themselves at risk if they send for their children , but the children as well . <EOS> <EOP> Sessions ’ s DOJ appears to be moving to pressure immigration judges to move through cases more quickly with this new rating system , as reported by the Post . <EOS> That would incentivize judges to do things , like stripping “ unaccompanied child ” protections , that would allow them to close a case more quickly . <EOS> And it would more generally be a problem for immigrants trying to pull together evidence to make the strongest possible asylum case . <EOS> <EOP> According to the Post , the DOJ has written in internal memos that it “ intends to implement numeric performance standards to evaluate [ immigration ] Judge performance. ” It ’ s not totally clear what those standards are . <EOS> But given Sessions ’ s complaints about the length of the court backlog — and guidance sent from DOJ headquarters to judges in July , discouraging them from being too lenient in allowing immigrants to reschedule their hearings for a later date while evidence is being gathered — immigration judges themselves are worried that they ’ re going to be stuck with “ production quotas ” for the number of cases they resolve . <EOS> <EOP> Doing this would require the government to change its current contract with the immigration judges union , which prohibits judges from being rated based on how many cases they resolve or how quickly they resolve them . <EOS> But the judges union told the Post the government is trying to do just that . <EOS> <EOP> Sessions doesn ’ t appear to be trying to control how judges resolve cases . <EOS> But the more pressure judges are placed under to resolve cases quickly , the less likely they are to agree to give immigrants time to make the strongest case — and the more likely they are to take any opportunity to deny that an immigrant is entitled to a full hearing at all . <EOS> <EOP> Ultimately , the administration ’ s goal is to stop as many people as possible — including children and families — from even trying to settle in the United States to begin with . <EOS> <EOP> Less than nine months since Trump ’ s inauguration , his government is already the victim of its own success on border security . <EOS> Trump came to office claiming that the US-Mexico border was so insecure that it was barely a border at all ( despite all evidence to the contrary ) . <EOS> But when the number of people ( especially Central American children and families ) coming to the US plummeted in the first few months of 2017 , Trump bragged that he ’ d fixed the problem simply by coming into office and talking tough , and now the border was secure . <EOS> <EOP> He probably wasn ’ t wrong — evidence suggests that people really were deterred from coming to the US because they were worried about what Trump would do . <EOS> But that didn ’ t last forever , because for children and families , there wasn ’ t much the Trump administration could do within the bounds of the law as it had been interpreted . <EOS> <EOP> And now the number of Border Patrol apprehensions has started creeping back up . <EOS> The Trump administration , in response , has flipped from celebrating its victory on border security to treating it as a “ crisis ” that requires immediate congressional help , and that justifies including all sorts of enforcement measures in Congress ’ s deal to address the fate of immigrants with DACA . <EOS> <EOP> The problem with the Trump administration judging its success on how few people even come to the US , though , is that it ’ s not really in the US ’ s control . <EOS> <EOP> The only thing they can do is punish as many of the people who do arrive as possible , and hope that they spread the word that coming to the US doesn ’ t work . <EOS> <EOP> It ’ s going to be hard to execute that kind of crackdown without outright violating the laws that guarantee due process in the name of humanitarian protection . <EOS> So , apparently , the Trump administration is trying to chip away at due process from the inside , and hoping that might be enough . <EOS> ",0

Spicer says Hitler did n't use chemical weapons,"White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Nazi German dictator “ didn ’ t even sink to using chemical weapons ” during World War II . <EOS> <EOP> “ You had -- someone as despicable as Hitler who didn ’ t even sink to the -- to using chemical weapons , ” Spicer told reporters at the White House briefing Tuesday . <EOS> “ So you have to , if you ’ re Russia , ask yourself , ‘ Is this a country that you and a regime you want to align your self with ? ’ ” <EOS> <EOP> Within hours , Spicer apologized . <EOS> “ Frankly , I mistakenly made an inappropriate and insensitive reference to the Holocaust , for which there is no comparison , ” Spicer said on CNN . <EOS> “ And for that I apologize . <EOS> It was a mistake to do that . ” <EOS> <EOP> The remark was meant to emphasize why the use of chemical weapons by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad necessitated an American military response . <EOS> <EOP> While chemical weapons weren ’ t widely used on th battlefield in the European theatre in World War II , Spicer ’ s comments immediately raised eyebrows because of the Nazi ’ s extensive and well-documented use of poison gas during the Holocaust . <EOS> Six million Jews were slaughtered in the Holocaust , many in Nazi gas chambers . <EOS> <EOP> Pressed by a reporter to clarify what he meant by this remark , Spicer said that he meant that Hitler had never used chemical weapons in the way Assad had , while acknowledging they were used by the Nazis during the Holocaust . <EOS> <EOP> “ I think when you come to sarin gas , he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing , ” Spicer said . <EOS> Of Hitler , Spicer said , “ He brought them into the Holocaust centers , I understand that . ” <EOS> <EOP> He then added : “ But in the way that Assad used them , where he went into towns , dropped them down to innocent -- in the middle of towns .... I appreciate the clarification…that was not the intent . ” <EOS> <EOP> After the briefing , the White House issued another statement : “ In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust , ” Spicer wrote . <EOS> “ I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers . <EOS> Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable . ” <EOS> <EOP> The clarifications didn ’ t come soon enough for the Anne Frank Center , which called on President Trump to “ fire Sean Spicer at once. ” The Center in a tweet called Spicer ’ s remarks “ the most evil slur upon a group of people we have ever heard from a White House press secretary . ” <EOS> <EOP> It was a call echoed by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi , who lambasted Spicer over his comments . <EOS> <EOP> “ While Jewish families across America celebrate Passover , the chief spokesman of this White House is downplaying the horror of the Holocaust , ” she waid in a statement . <EOS> “ Sean Spicer must be fired , and the President must immediately disavow his spokesman ’ s statements . <EOS> Either he is speaking for the President , or the President should have known better than to hire him . ” <EOS> <EOP> Later Tuesday , Defense Secretary James Mattis said “ even in World War II , chemical weapons were not used on battlefields. ” Chemical weapons were banned in 1925 under the Geneva protocol , a reaction to the horrors of World War I. Hitler , who was partially blinded by mustard gas in World War I , did not use the German stockpiles of chemical weapons on combatants on the battlefield , as Mattis noted . <EOS> But by the end of World War II , Hitler had killed nearly 6 million Jews , using poisonous gas to kill many of them . <EOS> ",0

Trump 's first 100 days on the global stage,"Washington ( CNN ) The 45th president entered office raging against a post-WWII order built by the United States , pledging instead that he would put `` America First . <EOS> <EOP> The US , President Donald Trump said during his campaign , could no longer afford to be the world 's policeman . <EOS> On the stump he also dismissed core alliances in Europe and Asia , raged at trade pacts , derided international organizations such as the UN and trash-talked allies ( Mexico ) and competitors ( China ) alike . <EOS> <EOP> But since his inauguration , Trump has steadily reversed course on those fronts and a host of others . <EOS> <EOP> The populist president has now embraced NATO , reaffirmed relationships with allies , reinforced international norms against chemical weapons use by bombing Syria and has sent more US troops to help rein in global conflicts . <EOS> <EOP> Almost 100 days after Trump entered the White House dismissing the international system , Trump seems to be assuming a US president 's traditional foreign policy role : being that system 's biggest defender . <EOS> <EOP> `` It 's a total 180 , '' said James Jeffrey , a former US ambassador to Iraq and Turkey . <EOS> `` And to a certain degree , it 's right . '' <EOS> <EOP> Analysts in Washington and overseas say a number of factors are at work , including the reality of dealing with global events , appeals from foreign leaders and the rise of experienced foreign policy mavens to Cabinet positions . <EOS> <EOP> But some caution that the President , with no foreign policy experience , hundreds of unfilled national security staff positions and a reliance on equally inexperienced family members , is a reactive and tactical leader who still lacks a strategic vision -- preferring to disseminate his thoughts in 140-character bursts . <EOS> <EOP> They also point to the fact that many of the problems shadowing Trump 's presidency in these first few months are tied to potentially compromising connections his circle has with global entities . <EOS> <EOP> The FBI is investigating whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow while Russia was allegedly hacking Democratic organizations to benefit the Republican candidate during 2016 . <EOS> Trump 's first national security adviser , retired Gen. Michael Flynn , had to step down after a controversial call with the Russian ambassador , while his work as a foreign agent during the transition has drawn scrutiny . <EOS> Meanwhile , the Trump family still maintains myriad international business holdings . <EOS> <EOP> Heather Conley , director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said these ties should check the optimism of any observers who think Trump is adopting a reassuringly standard approach to foreign policy . <EOS> <EOP> `` We 're comforting ourselves that this is normal and we should resist that view , '' she said . <EOS> <EOP> Every president goes through a learning curve and Trump is no exception . <EOS> <EOP> `` There 's no school for president , '' said Aaron David Miller , a former Middle East peace negotiator for the State Department now at the Wilson Center . <EOS> `` The issue for me is , is he learning ? <EOS> That 's the key question . '' <EOS> <EOP> Miller and Jeffrey pointed to the fact that Trump has surrounded himself with deeply experienced advisers , notably Defense Secretary James Mattis and national security adviser H.R . <EOS> McMaster . <EOS> <EOP> They `` believe deeply in this system , and there 's a reason we believe in this system , because the alternative is chaos , '' Jeffrey said . <EOS> <EOP> Trump has shown a willingness to defer to them , Miller added . <EOS> <EOP> Before his election , Trump backed torture . <EOS> After taking office , he reversed course , saying Mattis had told him he 'd always done better with `` a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers . '' <EOS> <EOP> Others , though , say giving them a seat at the table is n't enough . <EOS> <EOP> `` I 'm heartened by the fact that he appears to be listening to the counsel of those people , '' said Christine Wormuth , a former undersecretary of defense in the Obama administration . <EOS> `` I would not go so far as to say I 'm optimistic . '' <EOS> <EOP> Her concern , she said , is that `` it 's not clear to me President Trump has a real strategic vision for the role the United States should be playing . '' <EOS> <EOP> `` I have a sense of what America First means to him in terms of trade , but trade is only one dimension of our foreign policy , '' said Wormuth , a senior advisor in the CSIS International Security Program . <EOS> `` It 's one thing to say he wants better deals with this country or that country . <EOS> What about problems outside the trade sphere ? '' <EOS> <EOP> Trump has largely turned to the military to address global flashpoints , sending the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Korean Peninsula last week , dropping the `` Mother of All Bombs '' on ISIS positions in Afghanistan on April 13 and sending Tomahawk missiles into Syria the week before . <EOS> <EOP> At the same time , he 's moving to drastically cut the State Department budget , Wormuth noted . <EOS> <EOP> `` Everyone is focused on the Tomahawk strike , the dust-up with North Korea , '' Wormuth said . <EOS> `` Those were tactical responses . <EOS> Eventually the Trump administration is going to have to have an actual strategy and there 's going to have to be a diplomatic component if we 're going to have any real success . '' <EOS> <EOP> Miller pointed to an ongoing Trump evolution in which `` the realities of what it takes to campaign are giving way to the realities of governance , and that means adopting positions that are well considered and thought through . '' <EOS> <EOP> He points to an early declaration that the US would move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the contested city of Jerusalem ; the Trump campaign 's dismissal of the Export-Import Bank ; and the suggestion that Japan and South Korea develop their own nuclear weapons . <EOS> All these positions seem to have quietly been abandoned . <EOS> <EOP> Earlier this month , Trump alluded to the difference between campaigning and engaging with the world . <EOS> The President 's most pressing security challenge may be North Korea , which is poised to conduct a sixth nuclear test in its increasingly aggressive pursuit of a nuclear weapon and the means to deliver it . <EOS> Trump wants China to help with the challenge . <EOS> <EOP> Trump wrote on Twitter over the Easter weekend , `` Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem ? '' <EOS> <EOP> Foreign leaders have also had some sway , said Jeffrey , particularly Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders from Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia . <EOS> <EOP> `` The system has been very good to them , '' Jeffrey said of the global order , and they get `` nervous '' with a president `` who comes in and disses the whole thing . '' <EOS> <EOP> He continued , `` They all march off to Washington and plead to him , 'Be the world 's policeman , ' and he agreed . '' <EOS> <EOP> Jeffrey believes the shift in Trump 's view was reflected when Mattis , Vice President Mike Pence and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly affirmed the US commitment to NATO at a German security conference in February . <EOS> <EOP> `` That 's the moment when I think people started breathing a sigh of relief , '' Jeffrey said . <EOS> `` In that sense , it 's a return to normal . '' <EOS> <EOP> Others are n't yet sure . <EOS> Miller pointed to Trump 's mercurial character . <EOS> `` People do n't fundamentally change , '' he said . <EOS> `` Can you keep your demons in check ? <EOS> It gets to fundamental questions of character . '' <EOS> <EOP> Wormuth also questioned whether Trump can learn to be consistent : `` Part of what 's important in foreign policy is consistency and clarity in what you 're communicating to your friends and enemies . <EOS> Deploying unpredictabilty every now and then has value , but being seen by your allies as unreliable is dangerous . '' <EOS> <EOP> Conley , of CSIS , said the damage is already done . <EOS> `` Our foreign policy used to be built on principles , the international trading order , international law , the security framework , '' she said . <EOS> `` When you shake those foundations , no one can rely on anything . '' <EOS> <EOP> She pointed to the way longtime US allies are hedging , with Europe increasing its defense spending and Japan and Middle Eastern countries adjusting their defense posture and boosting arms purchases . <EOS> The EU has made warmer overtures to China and issued a strategic document that stressed the need to lessen its reliance on the US . <EOS> <EOP> Those alliances are `` like a vase , '' Conley said . <EOS> `` Once broken , you can glue it back together , but it 's never as strong as it once was .

Trump ’ s HHS Secretary Falls Apart When Asked If He Is Going To Sabotage Obamacare,"Trump ’ s HHS Secretary Tom Price fell apart when he was asked a very simple question on ABC ’ s This Week . <EOS> Price was asked are you going to sabotage the health care system or fix it , and all he could do was criticize Obamacare . <EOS> <EOP> RADDATZ : OK , let ’ s talk about what you ’ re going to do . <EOS> HHS has the ability to further destabilize the marketplace by stopping cost-sharing payments to insurers , not enforcing the individual mandate , working internally to undermine it . <EOS> You have said nobody is interested in sabotaging this system . <EOS> <EOP> So are you going to help it implode or try to fix it ? <EOS> <EOP> PRICE : That — the responsibility of the department is to improve the health and the safety and the well-being of the American people , and we take that mission extremely seriously . <EOS> Which is why we are so passionate about making certain that we ’ ve got a health care system , again , that works for patients . <EOS> <EOP> “ In January , the same American vessel fired warning shots from its .50 caliber machine gun to get the attention of four different craft that were coming too close , ” according to the Conservative Tribune . <EOS> <EOP> Right now , you ’ ve got a system that ’ s not working for patients . <EOS> You ’ ve got folks who give us calls every single day and let us know that the concern that they have about their inability to get care for their family . <EOS> We ’ ve got calls from physicians across this land who let us know that they ’ re no longer able to take care of the patients that they — they ’ re charged with caring for because of the rules and the regulations that are coming out of Washington . <EOS> <EOP> RADDATZ : Secretary Price , I just want to go back this — the president saying imploding . <EOS> It ’ s what the president is proposing , letting the existing system fail . <EOS> Putting the needs of patients first . <EOS> <EOP> PRICE : Martha , the current system is imploding . <EOS> The president has stated it . <EOS> I understand it . <EOS> The American people understand it . <EOS> Again , you ’ ve got insurance companies — you ’ ve got 83 insurance companies before the administration came into office that fled the market . <EOS> That said we can ’ t do this anymore . <EOS> <EOP> You ’ re going to have 40 percent of the counties in this country next year that only have one insurance company providing coverage ? <EOS> That ’ s not a choice . <EOS> You ’ re going to have dozens of counties in this country that have no insurance company providing coverage . <EOS> <EOP> This system has failed . <EOS> That ’ s what the president ’ s saying , and that ’ s why he is demanding that Congress act . <EOS> <EOP> If we could fix it by regulation , we would do so . <EOS> But it takes an act of Congress to take care of it , and that ’ s what the president is demanding . <EOS> <EOP> ABC ’ s Martha Raddatz asked the vital question . <EOS> Is Trump going to sabotage the health care system , or fix it ? <EOS> Sabotaging the ACA is not putting patients first as Republicans have been claiming that they are interested in doing . <EOS> <EOP> Trump and Congressional Republicans thought that they could blame Democrats for their failures on health care , but they are the ones responsible now . <EOS> If Trump undermines Obamacare , they own the consequences . <EOS> <EOP> Tom Price fell apart when Raddatz asked what he was going to do because the Trump White House has no answers that they want to admit publicly . <EOS> His ultimate answer was to blame Congress and say that he could do nothing , which is not true . <EOS> Price has a choice . <EOS> He can continue to make the cost sharing payments to insurers for the subsidies , or he can stop and crash the whole health care market . <EOS> <EOP> Republicans are responsible for the mess that they have made out of health care , and blaming Democrats is simply not going to cut it . <EOS> The point was made abundantly clear as Tom Price failed around and criticized Obamacare while offering zero solutions of his own . <EOS> ",1
The Left ’ s New Plan to Gut Religious-Liberty Protections,"On Tuesday , the New York Times ran an op-ed by Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse , “ On Contraception , It ’ s Church Over State. ” In her piece , Greenhouse bemoans the Trump administration ’ s recent decision to grant moral and religious objectors an exemption from Obamacare ’ s birth-control mandate : <EOS> <EOP> Unfortunately , Greenhouse is correct that many liberal and moderate Americans now hold disdain for religious freedom , which was once widely regarded as one of our foremost freedoms . <EOS> Indeed , religious liberty used to hold such bipartisan esteem in our country that when the Supreme Court curtailed the protections granted by the free-exercise clause of the Constitution , then-representative Charles Schumer sponsored that “ grandiloquently named Religious Freedom Restoration Act , ” or RFRA . <EOS> The House passed the legislation in a voice vote and the Senate quickly followed suit , passing it by a margin of 97–3 . <EOS> <EOP> Conservatives are well aware of this shift in support for religious liberty , having seen recent attempts by states to pass analogous religious-freedom laws stalled or defeated . <EOS> But there is a greater threat to religious liberty that , to date , has gone largely unnoticed : Liberal organizations are engaged in a concerted effort to strike down or limit religious accommodations by claiming that such laws violate the establishment clause of the Constitution . <EOS> <EOP> The establishment clause of the First Amendment provides that “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. ” While historically the establishment clause was interpreted as merely preventing Congress from establishing a state religion , the Supreme Court has long since abandoned that approach . <EOS> Instead , for over 45 years , the courts have applied the Lemon test , named after the Supreme Court case from which it sprang , Lemon v. Kurtzman . <EOS> Under the Lemon test , to be valid , a law must serve a secular purpose , not advance or inhibit religion , and not result in an “ excessive government entanglement ” with religion . <EOS> A law that fails to meet any of these three conditions violates the establishment clause . <EOS> <EOP> The Lemon test has long been used to challenge the constitutionality of religious displays on public property ( such as crosses and crèches ) and religious practices by government officials ( such as teacher-led prayers ) . <EOS> But now , liberals are now seeking to greatly expand establishment-clause jurisprudence to prohibit the government from accommodating religious beliefs . <EOS> <EOP> The ACLU took this tack in its recently filed legal challenge to the Trump administration ’ s decision to exempt religious organizations from Obamacare ’ s contraceptive mandate . <EOS> In its complaint , filed in a federal district court in California , the ACLU argued that , by providing a religious exemption , the government is advancing religion in violation of the establishment clause . <EOS> <EOP> Likewise , several weeks earlier the ACLU cited the establishment clause in Dumont v. Lyon , in which it is challenging a Michigan law giving religious child-placement organizations the right to place children in adoptive and foster families that conform to their beliefs . <EOS> The ACLU claimed that Michigan ’ s “ practice of allowing state-contracted , taxpayer-funded child placing agencies to disqualify prospective families headed by same-sex couples based on agencies ’ religious beliefs ” violates the establishment clause . <EOS> <EOP> This same establishment-clause argument has also been used recently to challenge a defense of the RFRA in EEOC v. R.G . <EOS> & G.R . <EOS> Harris Funeral Homes , which is currently pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit . <EOS> In that case , the EEOC sued Harris Funeral Homes for sex discrimination after the owner fired a male employee who wished to “ present ” at work as a woman and wear a dress , in violation of the company ’ s dress code . <EOS> At the district court level , the employer avoided liability for sex discrimination based on the protections guaranteed by the RFRA . <EOS> On appeal , the transgender employee sought to overturn the lower court ’ s decision by arguing that exempting Harris Funeral Homes from liability under the RFRA violates the establishment clause . <EOS> <EOP> These cases are not a fluke . <EOS> They represent the Left ’ s latest strategy for attacking religious liberty . <EOS> Current case law , however , suggests that such a strategy will fail . <EOS> The Supreme Court “ has long recognized that the government may ( and sometimes must ) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without violating the Establishment Clause. ” While the Court has also noted that “ at some point , accommodation may devolve into ‘ an unlawful fostering of religion , ’ ” such cases are the outliers . <EOS> For instance , the Court has already upheld the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act ( RLUIPA ) against a challenge on establishment-clause grounds . <EOS> ( RLUIPA is a corollary to RFRA that applies to state zoning laws and prison regulations . ) <EOS> <EOP> What ’ s more , where the government has created the burden on religious liberty , which is the case , for instance , with Obamacare , under the Court ’ s current jurisprudence , religious accommodations are unlikely to violate the establishment clause . <EOS> But with buyer ’ s remorse setting in , liberals are shopping for a better deal — and soon we will know whether they can get it . <EOS> <EOP> READ MORE : <EOS> <EOP> NR Editorial : A Win for Religious Conscience <EOS> <EOP> Religious Liberty Isn ’ t a Government Privilege <EOS> <EOP> Democrats Are Increasingly Comfortable with Religious Tests <EOS> <EOP> — Margot Cleveland is a lawyer , CPA , stay-at-home mom , and former full-time faculty member and current adjunct professor at the University of Notre Dame ’ s Mendoza College of Business . <EOS> ",0

ViaSat-2 : Satellite goliath goes into orbit,"The most powerful commercial broadband satellite ever built has just gone into orbit on an Ariane rocket . <EOS> <EOP> ViaSat-2 , which is to be stationed above the Americas , has a total throughput capacity of about 300 gigabits per second . <EOS> <EOP> The spacecraft was part of a dual payload on the Ariane flight . <EOS> It was joined by Eutelsat 172B , a UK/French-built platform to go over the Pacific . <EOS> <EOP> Both satellites will be chasing the rampant market for wi-fi on aeroplanes . <EOS> <EOP> Airlines are currently in a headlong rush to equip their fleets with connections that will allow passengers to use their mobile devices in mid-air . <EOS> <EOP> More than 6,000 commercial aircraft worldwide were offering an onboard wi-fi service in 2016 ;

it is where they are seeing double-digit growth . <EOS> <EOP> In the US , working with airlines such as JetBlue , ViaSat has already found success through its existing high-throughput ViaSat-1 spacecraft . <EOS> <EOP> With the extra capacity on ViaSat-2 , it aims to do better still . <EOS> <EOP> `` We think people want to use their devices in the air the way they do on the ground ; that 's the bet we 've made , '' said ViaSat Chief Operating Officer Rick Baldridge . <EOS> <EOP> `` JetBlue delayed their in-flight wi-fi offering , waiting for us , and now they 're giving it away for free and we 're providing 12 megabits per second to every seat , including streaming video , '' he told BBC News . <EOS> <EOP> ViaSat-2 's `` footprint '' touches the western coast of Europe , but aeroplanes travelling further east will be handed seamlessly to a better-positioned Eutelsat spacecraft , which should enable passengers to stay connected all the way across to Turkey if needs be . <EOS> <EOP> This is one of the benefits of the strategic alliance that the two satellite companies have formed . <EOS> And in time this will see the pair operate a ViaSat-3 platform together over Europe . <EOS> This spacecraft is being built to have a total throughput capacity of one terabit per second . <EOS> <EOP> From its position very close to the International Date Line , Eutelsat 's 172B spacecraft is going to target - amongst other business - the flight corridors of the Asia-Pacific region . <EOS> And it has some very smart British technology to do this in the form of a multi port amplifier . <EOS> <EOP> This can flexibly switch power between the satellite 's 11 spot beams to make sure the available bandwidth is always focused where it is needed most - whether that be on the planes moving east-west from Japan to California , say , or when they go in the other direction as a cluster at a different time of day . <EOS> <EOP> `` To oversimplify , in-flight connectivity has mostly been restricted to the US . <EOS> But now it is expanding into the Asia-Pacific region and it 's also coming to Europe , '' said Rodolphe Belmer , Eutelsat 's chief executive officer . <EOS> <EOP> `` We see spontaneous demand from airlines and it 's booming . <EOS> It 's true the technology has n't always delivered , but you will see with the introduction of very high throughput satellites in the next few years that we will be able to… bring a massive quantity of bandwidth onboard the plane , meaning you can stream Netflix in HD . <EOS> That 's a game-changer . '' <EOS> <EOP> Euroconsult is one of the world 's leading analyst groups following the satellite industry . <EOS> Its research confirms the rapid growth now taking place , and says this will only accelerate . <EOS> <EOP> Euroconsult 's recent report on in-flight-connectivity ( IFC ) predicted nearly half of all commercial planes would be enabled by 2021 , pushing revenues for the suppliers of onboard services from $ 1bn to $ 6.5bn inside 10 years . <EOS> But Euroconsult 's CEO , Pacôme Revillon , said there will be winners and losers in this IFC race and this would likely be decided in the very near future . <EOS> <EOP> `` Going to 2020 , approximately 50 % of aircraft could have opted for their chosen connectivity solutions , and certainly all of the major airlines will have made that choice . <EOS> By that stage the market share could decide who are the winners and losers , and we anticipate seeing some consolidation in this sector , with two to three companies coming to dominate the market , '' he told BBC News . <EOS> <EOP> Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET @ bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter : @ BBCAmos <EOS> ",0
Spike Lee Joins Kaepernick ’ s Stand Against ‘ Injustices In The USA ’,"It looks like Spike Lee is joining the rally for Colin Kaepernick . <EOS> <EOP> The film producer posted a photo — which included a misspelled version of Kaepernicks ’ last name — promoting the upcoming “ United We Stand rally for Colin Kapernick ” on Twitter Tuesday . <EOS> <EOP> The rally is scheduled to take place on August 23 , 2017 at the NFL Headquarters in New York City . <EOS> <EOP> In another tweet Lee made it clear that he wasn ’ t involved in organizing the protest , but pledged his support the Kaepernick and “ his stance on the injustices in the USA . ” <EOS> <EOP> The former San Francisco 49ers starter , who led the National Anthem protest against racial injustice last season , was released by the team after the 2016-17 season and is yet to find a place on another roster . <EOS> <EOP> Many believe that the quarterback ’ s political views are the sole reason he ’ s still a free agent , yet an inside NFL source told The Daily Caller Kaepernick has in fact turned down at least one contract — offered at the league minimum — this offseason . <EOS> <EOP> Persistence is a funny thing . <EOS> Either it ’ s an exalted sign of a noble being willing to suffer a task against all odds , or it ’ s an indication of an idiot unwilling to change his mind . <EOS> Fox News ’ s Sean Hannity likes to think he fits into the former camp . <EOS> But even Fox News knows he belongs in the latter . <EOS> <EOP> Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience . <EOS> For licensing opportunities of our original content , please contact [ email protected ] . <EOS> ",1

Hillary Clinton Says Russia Used Hacking ‘ to Great Effect ’ in Her Defeat,"Hillary Clinton left no doubt on Thursday that she believes Russia contributed to her defeat by interfering in the election , condemning what she called Moscow ’ s “ weaponization of information . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ I didn ’ t fully understand how impactful that was , ” Mrs. Clinton said at a women ’ s conference in New York . <EOS> She said she was convinced that intrusions into Democratic Party leaders ’ emails were carried out by Russian hackers under orders from President Vladimir V. Putin and aided by so-called online trolls and social media bots to spread disinformation . <EOS> <EOP> “ It is something that Putin has used inside Russia , outside Russia to great effect , ” Mrs. Clinton said , and she called for an independent investigation into Russian involvement . <EOS> <EOP> “ I ’ m hopeful that the Congress will pull together and realize that because of the success the Kremlin feels it ’ s had they ’ re not going to go away , ” Mrs. Clinton said . <EOS> “ So whatever party you are , whatever business you run , whatever concerns you have , if we don ’ t take action together to hold whoever was involved accountable , they will be back time and time again . ” <EOS> <EOP> Mrs. Clinton made the remarks at the Women in the World conference in Manhattan , where she was interviewed by the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof before an audience of about 3,000 people . <EOS> It was her first extensive interview since her loss in November to Donald J. Trump . <EOS> <EOP> She did not stint on criticism of the Trump White House . <EOS> “ I don ’ t take any pleasure in seeing the kind of chaotic functioning ” of the current administration , Mrs. Clinton said . <EOS> “ Here ’ s what I don ’ t understand — I don ’ t understand the commitment to hurt so many people that this administration , this White House seems to be pursing . ” <EOS> <EOP> Women in particular , she said , are under attack by Mr. Trump ’ s policies . <EOS> <EOP> “ The targeting of women — which is what ’ s going on — is absolutely , beyond any political agenda , ” Mrs. Clinton said , pointing in particular to the State Department ’ s move this week to defund the United Nations Population Fund , among other programs . <EOS> <EOP> She criticized efforts to strip maternity care and other treatments from Republicans ’ failed bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act . <EOS> “ They had not a clue what that meant , ” she said . <EOS> “ I don ’ t know if any of them had ever even read the bill ! ” <EOS> <EOP> She also noted that it was mostly men who were behind the push to curtail women ’ s health benefits . <EOS> <EOP> In the aftermath of Charlottesville it is more clear than ever that there is no shortage of pawns for the New World Order . <EOS> The armies of ignorance are gathering , and here are three signs you might be among them . <EOS> <EOP> “ The things that come out of some of these men ’ s mouths — like , ‘ Why do we have to cover maternity care ? ’ ” she said with a laugh . <EOS> “ Well I don ’ t know , maybe you were dropped by immaculate conception ? ” <EOS> <EOP> She said Mr. Trump ’ s two attempts at ordering travel bans aimed at people from a handful of predominantly Muslim countries had “ really sent a chilling effect across the world to not just Muslims , but to all kinds of people who said , ‘ Wait a second , don ’ t you still have Lady Liberty in the New York Harbor ? ’ ” <EOS> <EOP> Mrs. Clinton , in an unvarnished dig at the president , noted that Mr. Putin “ shook my hand ” when they met , a reference to Mr. Trump ’ s failure to shake the hand of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany . <EOS> <EOP> Mrs. Clinton seemed to dismiss rumors that she would some day run for New York City mayor , saying that while she had a lot of work to do , “ I don ’ t think that will include ever running for office again . ” <EOS> <EOP> She was occupied , she said , with the unfinished business of the last century — “ the rights and opportunities for women and girls . ” <EOS> <EOP> “ I think I have a lot to do , ” she said . <EOS> <EOP> She said she was puzzled by the fact that she was popular as secretary of state under President Barack Obama , according to polls at the time she left that job , but unpopular as a candidate . <EOS> <EOP> “ Well , what happened ? ” she said . <EOS> “ Oh my gosh , by the time they finished with me , I was Typhoid Mary . ” <EOS> <EOP> The difference , she said , was that as secretary , “ it was a job that I was asked to do by a man. ” As a presidential candidate , she was propelled by her own ambition , a quality , she said , that studies show is seen as unappealing in a woman . <EOS> <EOP> Mrs. Clinton grew particularly forceful in condemning Syria ’ s recent chemical attack and called for a strong military response to confront President Bashar al-Assad and “ take out his airfields. ” While no decision has made , there have been reports that the Pentagon is considering airstrikes . <EOS> <EOP> Mrs. Clinton said she was at work on a book that would delve deeply into the events leading up to the election , including the decision by the F.B.I . <EOS> director , James B.

Fanged creature found on Texas beach after Hurricane Harvey,"A mysterious fanged sea creature that washed up on a beach in Texas following Hurricane Harvey has been identified . <EOS> <EOP> Preeti Desai found the decaying fish on a beach in Texas City , and asked Twitter for help . <EOS> <EOP> She posted several photos with the caption : `` Okay , biology twitter , what the heck is this ? '' <EOS> <EOP> Her request was passed to biologist and eel specialist Dr Kenneth Tighe , who believes it is a fangtooth snake-eel . <EOS> <EOP> He said it may also be a garden or conger eel , because `` all three of these species occur off Texas and have large fang-like teeth '' . <EOS> <EOP> It is thought that Hurricane Harvey , which brought strong winds and flooding to Texas , could explain why the creature was washed up . <EOS> <EOP> The fangtooth snake-eel , also known as a `` tusky '' eel , is usually found in waters between 30 and 90 metres deep in the western Atlantic ocean . <EOS> <EOP> Ms Desai , who was at the beach assessing the damage from the hurricane , told the BBC : `` It was completely unexpected , it 's not something that you 'd typically see on a beach . <EOS> I thought it could be something from the deep sea that might have washed on to shore .

Be Very Careful Before Beating the War Drums in Syria,"War has consequences . <EOS> Callous incompetence has consequences . <EOS> The world is watching those consequences unfold in Syria today . <EOS> No one can look at images of children dead from gas attacks and not be moved . <EOS> <EOP> Let ’ s stipulate two things : First , there were never any easy American choices in Syria . <EOS> Second , the Obama administration got virtually every hard choice wrong . <EOS> Or , to be more precise , the choices it did make did nothing to either stop the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the new century or block our enemies and rivals , Iran and Russia , from exerting their will in Syria . <EOS> <EOP> The result is the Syria we have today , a patchwork quilt of competing zones of control that in some ways looks more complicated than it is . <EOS> Let ’ s make sense of the map below : <EOS> <EOP> The red , government-controlled areas represent the most populated and economically consequential sections of the country . <EOS> This is where Russia and Iran have asserted their will , and this is where Assad is spilling the blood of innocents to expand and maintain his grip on power . <EOS> Yes , he ’ s still opposed by rebel groups , but they ’ ve been decimated , and many of the groups that remain are dominated by jihadists . <EOS> <EOP> In the north , our Kurdish allies are on the move , but not against the regime — against ISIS . <EOS> In other words , Assad has beaten his main foe and is leaving the United States , the Kurds , and assorted other allies to deal with our main foe , ISIS . <EOS> After the battle for Raqqa , Syria is likely to be effectively partitioned , with American-backed forces controlling the north , the Russian-backed regime controlling the west , and some small forces still battling it out on the borders . <EOS> <EOP> As we confront the Assad regime ’ s gas attack — which is just one of its countless violations of the law of war , and hardly its most deadly — we also have to confront this core reality : Our leading geopolitical rival — a traditional great power and a nuclear superpower — has quite obviously decided that the survival of a friendly regime in Damascus is a core national interest . <EOS> It acted decisively while we dithered , and it has boots on the ground . <EOS> <EOP> Thus , we now face a quandary . <EOS> Retaliate against Syria so strongly that it truly punishes and weakens Assad , and you risk threatening Russia ’ s vital interests . <EOS> Respond with a pinprick strike that Russia effectively “ permits , ” and you do nothing important . <EOS> Assad has demonstrated that he cares little about his own casualties and may ( like many other American enemies before him ) actually feel emboldened after “ surviving ” an American strike . <EOS> <EOP> Let me add one other thing . <EOS> On this , the 100th anniversary of America ’ s entry into World War I , it ’ s worth noting that outside the ever-shrinking number of World War II veterans , this nation has no memory of what great-power conflict is like . <EOS> Considering whether to strike a close Russian ally is not like considering whether to drone a terrorist camp in rural Pakistan or raid an al-Qaeda village in the Yemeni countryside . <EOS> Even a single skirmish with a nation like Russia could inflict more American casualties in one day than , say , the last few years of combined military operations in Afghanistan , Iraq , and elsewhere . <EOS> <EOP> That doesn ’ t mean we should operate from a posture of fear and timidity but rather from one of sobriety and wisdom . <EOS> It also means that if we choose to escalate our military operations — to directly strike where Russia has planted its flag — then the American people need to have their voice heard , through their elected representatives . <EOS> We should not stumble our way into conflict . <EOS> We should not lash out in anger and rage ( no matter how justified ) without carefully considering our strategy . <EOS> <EOP> There are those who say , “ Putin wouldn ’ t dare oppose us , ” and they may well be right . <EOS> But mights and maybes are thin assurances when the stakes are this high , and striking Assad is hardly our only option . <EOS> We can follow through with our commitment to defeat ISIS , then help our allies consolidate control in the north , limiting Assad to his rump state in the west . <EOS> We can facilitate the creation of safe zones where refugees can live free from fear of Assad ’ s gas and cluster bombs . <EOS> And we can sanction both Russia and Iran for propping up a genocidal dictator , helping turn a short-term military victory into a longer-term economic quagmire for them . <EOS> <EOP> Not one of those actions is particularly satisfying , and none of them provide an immediate answer to the present crisis , but a multitude of past mistakes leave America with few good options . <EOS> Respond to Assad , yes , but strike him ?

Celebrity Chef Amanda Freitag ’ s Rules for Home Cooking,"There 's been a feud with a key Republican senator , a flare-up at a professional football game with President Trump instructing his vice president to walk out when players ( on the most activist team in the NFL ) knelt during the national anthem , and he even questioned the IQ of his secretary of state . <EOS> <EOP> This is a big deal because Corker could be key in passing a tax overhaul and reimposing sanctions on Iran if the president tries to upend the current nuclear agreement struck under the Obama presidency . <EOS> Corker is n't running for reelection and is now free to speak his mind publicly — in a way few other Republican senators have been . <EOS> <EOP> The judge on the Food Network ’ s acclaimed competition show ‘ Chopped ’ opens up about her favorite type of salt , the challenges of apartment kitchens , and the appeal of citrus zest . <EOS> <EOP> `` It 's easy to be bold when you 're not coming back , '' Meadows said . <EOS> <EOP> Watching Vice President Pence walk out of an NFL game was stunning . <EOS> And signs indicate it may have been planned . <EOS> <EOP> Some chefs are strict about measuring ingredients , others not so much . <EOS> Which camp do you fall into ? <EOS> “ I ’ m definitely a no measure chef . <EOS> I had a very hard time writing The Chef Next Door , a cookbook that has 100 recipes . <EOS> The hardest part about the cookbook was making sure the recipes worked . <EOS> I would wake up with nightmares . <EOS> Oh , my god , what if somebody gets the book and they make a recipe and it doesn ’ t work ? ” <EOS> <EOP> It comes on the heels of Trump 's spat with the mayor of San Juan , Puerto Rico , as well as his odd and mysterious threat about a `` calm before the storm '' while meeting with military leaders . <EOS> ( Mostly , that seemed to be a tease , to build drama , and , frankly , mess with the media . <EOS> Cable news outlets were obsessing over the comment for hours . <EOS> Could something be in the works ? <EOS> Maybe , but there have been plenty of other things Trump has teased were coming soon , but never did . ) <EOS> <EOP> Do you ever use cookbooks ? <EOS> “ Cookbooks for me are purely inspiration . <EOS> I will look at maybe the title of a recipe or a photo and I ’ ll think oh , I know what I want to make now . <EOS> It just sparks something . ” <EOS> <EOP> Apron or no apron ? <EOS> “ You know what ? <EOS> I actually wear an apron . <EOS> Chefs always wore a uniform but now we just see chefs in their t-shirts with a cool apron on . <EOS> I miss the days of wearing a uniform . <EOS> At heart , I ’ m a line cook . <EOS> I kind of miss the chef coat because when I put that on then I ’ m on . <EOS> But I have to say , when I ’ m at home and I ’ m cooking I do like having an apron on . <EOS> I do . <EOS> It just feels right . <EOS> When you ’ re done and you sit down at the table you take your apron off . ” <EOS> <EOP> After all your years behind a stove , do you still enjoy cooking for people at home ?

<EOS> “ I ’ m a little bit old-school in the way that I don ’ t use tweezers . <EOS> I ’ m not opposed to them entirely . <EOS> I ’ ve grabbed them and used them when somebody else has them . <EOS> I use spoons . <EOS> I use spatulas . <EOS> I use tongs to turn meat but never for fish . ” <EOS> <EOP> Why ?

<EOS> “ I ’ m starting to slowly gather equipment but honestly the one thing that sits on my counter every day is a blender , my Vitamix . <EOS> That and my coffeepot . <EOS> Everything else gets put away and taken back out when I need it . ” <EOS> <EOP> Do you bring home menus from restaurants ? <EOS> “ I usually like to take menus from wherever I go . <EOS> I just moved into this new place and when you move you try to purge and it ’ s like here another box of menus . <EOS> Here ’ s another box of menus . <EOS> Do I keep this one ? <EOS> Do I keep that one ? <EOS> I don ’ t like to throw them away . ” <EOS> <EOP> What ’ s your favorite kind of salt ? <EOS> “ I love kosher salt . <EOS> And I do like sea salt for finishing . <EOS> Iodized salt is so fine and so dangerous . <EOS> As soon as you pour it onto something you are in salt land . <EOS> You don ’ t taste flavor any more . <EOS> You just taste salt . <EOS> Kosher salt has a bigger grain and it ’ s easier to control . <EOS> Sea salt is the same way and that has a better flavor . <EOS> Iodized is so fine and it comes out so fast . ” <EOS> <EOP> Are there any ingredients that you ’ ve become burnt out using ? <EOS> “ No , I would never give up on anything . <EOS> It ’ s a good to take a break if you ’ ve made something 100 times . <EOS> You get burnt out on that dish . <EOS> So , step away and do something else for a while . ” <EOS> ",1
